International and local collaboration efforts have been made with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality or ""net-zero"" emissions; thus, policies and technological innovations have been developed. Such impact-oriented risk assessment and control efforts amount to carbon-neutral pathways. Although such pathways may diverge in terms of energy, resources, and cost, it is critical to summarize essential and promising preparatory work on related policies and technologies to inform both policy-makers and social scientists to take actions. Through a scientometric analysis and systematic review of the latest social science literature, the study identified the size, scope and exemplar work for each social science discipline on carbon neutrality, based on 907 articles collected in early 2021 from the Web of Science database. This study reveals a set of disciplines focusing on certain common and distinct aspects of carbon neutrality. By outlining the possibilities and application areas for future research and policy development for socio-technical transition towards a net-zero or post-carbon future, this study has contributed to the understanding of the global efforts to achieve a clearer and viable carbon-neutral pathway. In conclusion, as many aspects of the planet and humans have become datafied, digitized, and networked, carbon neutrality, as the ecological indicator that guide human production and consumption patterns, must take on a central role in guiding our conscious green digital transformation of many political, economic, social and psychological aspects of our societies according to the existing and emerging social science knowledge.</p>"	[Zhang, Yuan;

To address this problem, the conflict of interests among P2P lending participants is discussed using a stakeholder approach. An evolutionary game model (EGM) of three players is developed to analyse the interactions among regulatory authorities, P2P lending platforms, and borrowers. Then, the asymptotic of the equilibrium and evolutionary stability strategies of the EGM are analysed. Results indicate that either the P2P lending platforms or borrowers will choose ""noncompliant operation"" or ""default"" strategies from a short-term perspective, and the strict supervision of the P2P lending platform in the short term is necessary for the sustainable operation of the platform. When supervision is intensified in the early stage and regulatory pressure becomes a normal state, P2P lending platforms and borrowers will actively select ""compliant operation"" and ""repayment"" strategies even if there is a lack of regulation in the future. Meanwhile, the behavioural strategies of P2P lending participants can be changed to conform to the sustainability of P2P lending by reducing the costs of strict supervision and increasing the damage caused by general supervision, reward and punishment coefficient for P2P lending platforms, repayment incentives of borrowers, and defaulting opportunity costs. Finally, suggestions for regulating the behaviours of P2P lending participants and promoting sustainability of P2P lending industry are discussed."

The present study aims to explore the theoretical underpinning of low participation in screening programs using the method of meta-analytic structural equation modeling. It was found that the health belief model is the most adopted theoretical framework. Moreover, the intended uptake of screening was positively predicted only by cues to action, health literacy, and perceived susceptibility. As a result, a health intention model, including the three significant variables, is proposed. The practical implications of the findings are that health communication campaigns should focus on enlightening and engaging the public through all necessary means to raise awareness and transfer knowledge in relation to screening procedures as well as cancers per se.

126	J	Wen, CY				Wen Cuiyan			At the juncture of reform, heritage making of an industrial town in Pearl River Delta region	CULTURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Intangible cultural heritage; heritage making; economic reform; Pearl River Delta region; local governments; the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics		In October 2017 at the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping declared the arrival of 'the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics', which is believed to herald a period distinct from Deng Xiaoping's era of Reform and Opening-up since the late 1970s. Concepts of 'cultural confidence' and 'the China dream', 'the great rejuvenation' marking the new historic period have actually been conceived as early as the mid-1990s and fully unfolded since the early 2000s. Therefore, the turn of the century marks the transition between the reform era and the 'new era'. During this juncture, the emergence of heritage making became a signature phenomenon. It plays a prominent role in reshaping the cultural identity of common Chinese people, their perception of everyday tradition and the cultural orientation of economic life. This essay examines the heritage making of the town of Dongkeng, an ordinary industrial town located in the Pearl River Delta area, a symbolic region of the Reform and Opening-up. As the labour-intensive economic model went into crisis in the early 2000s, culture - especially folk and traditional culture - was adopted by local governments to earn new scoring points of economic growth and urban regeneration. Based on policy analysis and fieldwork interviews, I examine how the town tactically made use of intangible heritage to re-organize local cultural resources. Heritage making became the response to the town's desire of economic restructuring in the process. It also refashions the cultural narratives of economic restructuring. The essay concludes that the heritage process is one of re-organizing and interweaving everyday traditions and practices into local economic schemes, and this consolidated orientation of cultural identity characterizes China's transition towards a 'new era' of socio-economic development.

To provide an up-to-date discussion on FinTech, the paper aims to map out the main countries, publications, institutions, and topics of the related research based on the Web of Science (WoS) database. The findings based on the 494 articles show that publications have experienced rapid growth since 2015 and that fintech research has involved several disciplines, such as e-commerce, finance, sustainability studies, information management, economics, business, organization law, etc. Also, several U.S., Chinese, U.K., and Australian institutions have been shown to be prominent in hosting such interdisciplinary work. In addition, five main research clusters include (a) digitization- or even ecosystem-based innovations, (b) internet finance and its regulation, (c) cryptocurrencies and blockchains, (d) financial inclusion and trust, and (e) AI and regulation technologies (or regtech). By showing the research fronts of fintech, the scientometric analysis also highlights the research gap at the intersections of green finance and smart finance.

However, there is no comprehensive review on the topic specifically on service design for the fields of public health and public administration. Based on the current discussions on the value of design for public health and public administration, the paper presents a systematic literature review into the specific discussions on service design, with the purpose to provide better public service innovations, especially in the context of recognizing the human needs in the technological digital advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and Cloud Computing. The paper outlines the areas of applications, issues, and challenges for future research and policy innovations. By analyzing top keywords and authors from 529 articles, collected from the Web of Science database, the scientometric study reveals an emerging loose network of concepts and authors. Although the impact of such work remains limited at its early stage of development, the combination of both human-centered insights and system thinking processes at the organization levels, brought by the service design approach, has shown to tackle some of the wicked problems of public health and public administration. Future research and design workshops can be conducted to reinvigorate the notion of people-centered commitments for public service innovations, with societal relevance and scientific rigor.

With the help of network technologies such as audio and video transmission, image recognition processing and data collaboration, it records the video signals, electronic equipment signals, audio signals of teachers and students, and transmits them in real-time through the network to simulate the real course environment. This article takes the online courses of Chinese universities as the background, and focuses on the interactive ritual chain in the online courses. Research has found that a good online course helps to form a stable teacher-student interaction, so that both parties can gain attention and respect. Simultaneously, the suppression of power, the restriction of formalization, and the imbalance of symbolic capital will affect the participation of teachers and students in interactive rituals to a certain extent. Creating a good teacher-student interaction situation and integrating informational and humanized interactive processes will help promote college online teaching effects.

With the aim to provide a systematic review of the literature on self-tracking, this paper presents a scientometric analysis of 109 articles since 2000 collected from the Web of Science. Based on keyword co-occurrence network analysis, the paper has identified four major clusters: (1) wearables as quantified-self applications; (2) big data and critical theory; (3) data and privacy; (4) personal informatics. The further keywords-in-context (KWIC) analysis of the abstracts of the dataset clarifies the seemingly-interchangeable notions of ldquoself-trackingrdquo and ldquoquantified-selfrdquo: While ldquoself-trackingrdquo refers to more general activities, practices, technologies, and applications of keeping tracks, ldquoquantified-selfrdquo refers to the more conscious efforts and meaning-making outcomes of the self-tracking activities. Such clarification, along with the keyword network analysis, suggests that self-tracking has become a specific and major type of datafication of human conditions or existence and that quantified-self is the construction of self through such datafication. A more integrated conceptual framework is needed for future research to better understand what amounts to meaningful datafication of human conditions and existence, thereby helping researchers and designers to discern the classic notions of health, wellness, and happiness for better research and design outcomes.

At present, self-tracking products with the dashboard as the main interface face challenges in negative user experience and high abandon. In this paper, we try to improve the user experience of such technologies by paying more attention to the role of the user's emotions on the visualization and enhance their willingness to continue to use. Based on our previous study on people-centered self-tracking system design, we think the avatars should be a better choice than dashboards of self-tracking technologies. In order to detect whether avatars can bring more positive emotions than the dashboards, and to reduce abandon, we designed and implemented three phases of usability testing: a questionnaire of popular self-tracking applications in the market, a self-tracking product emotional research based on avatar and dashboards, and a questionnaire based on self-tracking APP prototype with avatar template. Through these usability testing, we obtained results that users are more tend to adopt the avatar one. This paper then proposed results that 9 emotions are significantly different when using these two different interface designs of self-tracking visualization. With such results of research, two implication for principles of sustainable interaction design of self-tracking applications had been proposed in this paper as 1) Understandability; 2) Performance optimizations. We hope to provide a new form of visualization for the interface design of self-tracking technology and complement usability research results of such design.

Therefore, using design thinking and system thinking to guide both digital transformation and green transformation gains more significance under such circumstances. Still, there is no systematic review of how user experience advances green and digital transformation. The purpose of the article is to provide a cross-disciplinary groundwork of user experience design related to green and digital transformation. User experience certainly occurs at every stage of a digital project so that both the user and service producer can refer to the result of this literature review and build more contributions upon it. This systematic review of user experience design literature on the topic has summarized the annual trends since 1995, main research disciplines, and publication outlets based on a scientometric analysis of 250 articles collected from the Web of Science database. Future research can build upon the preliminary findings here for the methodological, information, and research need for tracking the development of user experience design that advances digital transformation.

Along with digital technology, the main driver of industry 4.0, service design can be able to affect every aspect of the product life cycle, so that the production, delivery, consumption, and investment can be more sustainable. Therefore, how can we advance service design for system change bears great potential for addressing complex issues towards green and digital transformation. However, a comprehensive review of the intersections of related works of literature is missing. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of the core literature and identify future research directions and challenges so that organizations can better utilize service design for green and digital transformation. Based on 549 articles retrieved from the Web of Science database, this research examined the main journals, emerging disciplines, and top author keywords, summarizing the major work surrounding the relationship between digital transformation and service design. The research found that researches on the intersection of service design and digital transformation have been undertaken mainly in three disciplines: industrial engineering, business and management science, environmental studies and green technology. Also, service design and Product-Service System can help organizations navigate the required transformation processes. The paper also suggests the need to further explore the intersection of service design and related research fronts of data-driven, SMEs, and future studies, with specific questions raised.

When climate change has been shaping the cultural attitudes and values, it becomes also relevant for the very organizations to adopt practices that advance both human and sustainable development. Thus, creative and cultural sectors need strategies to navigate the increasing need of green and digital transformation. To date, little research has been conducted on this topic, and thus this exploratory bibliometric analysis aims to fill the gap by a systematic review of the relevant literature. Based on 991 articles, this paper outlines the main areas of discussions and issues as well as the opportunities and challenges for research and policy innovations. The findings have revealed the significance of tourism, sustainability and Internet in the state-of-art literature, thereby highlighting the need for an integrated approach to green and digital transformation for creative and cultural industries. Future research can be conducted across different creative and cultural sectors, so as to allow researchers to generalize and construct the notion of smart and sustainable cultural consumption and production (SCP) as the timely and relevant contribution to the wider sustainable SCP literature.

However, there is no comprehensive review or theory-driven work that comes from the research area of the digital economy itself. This exploratory study, based on a scientometric analysis of digital economy literature, aims to outline the possibilities and application areas for future research and policy development for HCI research and its intelligent applications. By identifying and analyzing top key authors from 2,778 articles and their more than 100,000 citations, collected from the Web of database, the study reveals a dense network with a few clusters of concepts and research work.

Proceedings. Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS 12615)			English	Conference Paper	Intelligent Human Computer Interaction. 12th International Conference, IHCI 2020	24-26 Nov. 2020	Daegu, South Korea			Practical/ Big Data; electronic publishing; human computer interaction; Web sites/ intelligent HCI; journalistic products; HCI design; digital journalism; human-computer interaction; Web of Science database; WoS database; Big Data/ C7230 Publishing and reproduction; C6130 Data handling techniques; C6180 User interfaces; C7210N Information networks		Previous research has been exploring the user experiences, interface design, and production processes of journalistic products, and it is important to continue such discussions on how better Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research and practices improve the production and consumption of news. Specifically, because of the development of Big Data and AI digital technologies, it is now vital to investigate how such technologies can be integrated into the HCI design for better user experience. With the aim to systematically examine digital journalism research fronts for better HCI, a scientometric study has been conducted by analyzing 2156 articles on digital journalism, collected from the Web of Science (WoS) database, so as to critically evaluate the extant literature investigating such relationship between HCI and digital journalism for future research directions. By analyzing major disciplines, core publications, keywords, and key authors' ideas, this study found that the multidisciplinary knowledge surrounding digital journalism, especially top disciplines such as communication, computer science, information science & library science can be divided into four main categories: journalism and framing; interactivity; analytics and metrics; big data and transparency. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a better overall picture on the relationship between journalism and interaction design, thereby helping advancing both fields with preliminary but important findings.

Proceedings. Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS 12615)			English	Conference Paper	Intelligent Human Computer Interaction. 12th International Conference, IHCI 2020	24-26 Nov. 2020	Daegu, South Korea			Practical/ artificial intelligence; Big Data; data privacy; human computer interaction; sentiment analysis; social networking (online)/ smart social media; social interactions; artificial intelligence; intelligent HCI; Chinese social media platforms; intelligent human computer interaction; Big Data; Twitter; Facebook; sentiment analysis; related keywords; privacy issues/ C7210N Information networks; C7240 Information analysis and indexing; C6210 Knowledge based systems; C6130D Document processing and analysis techniques; C6130S Data security; C6180N Natural language processing		As social media shapes human behavior and social interactions, especially with the help of Big Data and artificial intelligence, it becomes an important site for policy and design interventions. Since no systematic review on social media research for intelligent HCI has been conducted, the article presents exploratory findings on a scientometric analysis of the literature at the intersections of social media and AI. By identifying and discussing the main and emerging disciplines and the related keywords from 2,443 articles along with more than 18,000 citations, the findings show that while Twitter and Facebook have been the main platforms for study, Chinese social media platforms emerge as new sites of research with the COVID-19. Also, sentiment analysis appears to be the most prominent research practices, with implications on the issues of privacy, misinformation, depression, and mental health). Four key dimensions of social media are summarized as foundations for the proposed research agenda for intelligent HCI that is not only smart, but also fair and inclusive.
