The result shows that students have higher scores in curiosity, challenge and adventure but lower scores in imagination. On the other hand, they performed better in originality but normal in fluency and flexibility. Moreover, data of different genders, grades and foreign language majors shows consistency in fluency, flexibility, originality and creativity. Based on the above investigation and the important role PBL (Project-based Learning) has played in improving the cognitive ability which composes of thinking ability, the author designs a PBL cultivation mode by putting forward the thinking training methods into the process of PBL in order to make joint efforts to cultivate college students' innovative thinking ability.

J	INSPEC:21141793	Conference Paper			Exploring the influence of psychological empowerment on student's learning performance in a blended learning environment based on the structural equation model	Li Yu Tseng; Chiou Fong Wei; Ying Ying Zhang						2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education (ICAIE)	2021	2021					314	318	314-18			2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education (ICAIE)	18-20 June 2021	Dali, China			English	Today's Generation Z students have entered to the university. Traditional teaching cannot meet their learning needs. Teachers must create an environment that can enhance their learning abilities. This paper aims to explore how to use teachers' psychological empowerment to increase students' creativity, learning satisfaction, and learning performance in a blended learning environment. After collecting 172 valid questionnaires, this research uses the structural equation model to verify the proposed conceptual model. This study used Cronbach's alpha (> 0.7), CR (> 0.7), and AVEs (> 0.5) to test the reliability and the validity of the construct. Besides, the chi2/df ratio (< 3.0) and other indicators of goodness of fit (RMSEA= 0.059, CFI= 0.97, IFI= 0.96, NFI= 0.97) were used to test the model fit. The results show that teachers' psychological empowerment has a positive impact on students' creativity (beta = 0.44, p < 0.001), learning satisfaction (beta = 0.25, p < 0.001) and learning performance (beta = 0.17, p < 0.001). Students' creativity (beta= 0.78, p< 0.001) and learning satisfaction (beta= 0.18, p< 0.01) have a positive impact on their learning performance.

However, there is no comprehensive review on the topic specifically on service design for the fields of public health and public administration. Based on the current discussions on the value of design for public health and public administration, the paper presents a systematic literature review into the specific discussions on service design, with the purpose to provide better public service innovations, especially in the context of recognizing the human needs in the technological digital advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and Cloud Computing. The paper outlines the areas of applications, issues, and challenges for future research and policy innovations. By analyzing top keywords and authors from 529 articles, collected from the Web of Science database, the scientometric study reveals an emerging loose network of concepts and authors. Although the impact of such work remains limited at its early stage of development, the combination of both human-centered insights and system thinking processes at the organization levels, brought by the service design approach, has shown to tackle some of the wicked problems of public health and public administration. Future research and design workshops can be conducted to reinvigorate the notion of people-centered commitments for public service innovations, with societal relevance and scientific rigor.

Due to the influence of Chinese people's cultural concept of elderly care, most of the elderly are more inclined to home-based care, enjoy the happiness of children and grandchildren, and enjoy family happiness. At present, there are some problems in home-based health care services, such as lack of professional talents and single service mode. This entrepreneurial project which is proposed by Wish Magic has grasped the pain points of China's elderly care problems, and brought about some problems. Efforts should be made to build a sharing platform for elderly care services, attract professionals to provide professional services for the elderly, and hold diversified activities to meet the material and spiritual needs of the elderly. The planned market strategy of the project is divided into three steps. Firstly, the project will be carried out in the first and second tier cities, and then expanded to the third tier cities. Later, the market will be expanded to the fourth tier cities. At the same time, the project will cooperate with government departments to strive for government funding and policy support, and provide accurate services in combination with online and offline ways, so as to meet the diversified pension needs of the elderly.

It is a scientific and professional assessment system, which is regarded as the best tool to solve the conflict between economic growth and environmental protection. The implementation of the environmental impact assessment system can undoubtedly prevent some construction projects from having serious adverse impact on the environment. Through the comparison and selection of the feasibility schemes, the environmental impact of some construction projects can be minimized. Therefore, the environmental impact assessment system is regarded as an important pillar and effective legal system for the implementation of predictive environmental policy, which has attracted more and more attention in the world. In order to implement the strategy of sustainable development, prevent the adverse impact on the environment caused by the implementation of planning and construction projects, and promote the coordinated development of economy, society and environment, China has formulated the environmental impact assessment law. The law came into force on September 1, 2003 and was amended for the second time on December 29, 2018.

To fully exploit the local correlations, we propose a novel efficient RDH using filter selection. Firstly, we divide the cover image into multiple non-overlapping layers following the concept of image down-sampling. Then data is embedded in a layer-wise manner. For data embedding, the prediction-error and the local complexity are estimated using the idea of block-based image filtering, the related techniques of which have been widely studied in the area of image processing. Experimental results validate the applicability of the proposed work in the perspectives of both embedding capacity and image quality.

The structural relationship among environmental, personal, and behavioral factors is first proposed and then explored, which considers multiple influences including environmental pollution, mass media, social norms, self-monitoring, self-preference, self-efficacy, personal outcome expectation, and conscious waste-sorting. Then, the model is empirically analyzed using PLS structural equation modeling on a sample of Shanghai citizens collected from an online questionnaire survey. The results showed that social norms (beta = 0.387, p < 0.001) and self-monitoring (beta = 0.433, p < 0.001) had a positive impact on self-efficacy, which in turn, led to personal outcome expectation (beta = 0.221, p < 0.001) and conscious waste-sorting behavior (beta = 0.412, p < 0.001). Based on this observation, the study also develops strategies to strengthen the conscious waste-sorting behavior to protect the environment.

J	INSPEC:20691508	Conference Paper			Design and Implementation of E-commerce Recommendation System Model Based on User Clustering	Zhong Xiao Ying; Si Ming Yuan						2020 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Human-Computer Interaction (ICHCI 2020)	2020	2020					265	268	265-8			2020 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Human-Computer Interaction (ICHCI 2020)	4-6 Dec. 2020	Sanya, China			English	Under the general trend of mobile Internet, more and more industries began to change from traditional business model to e-commerce, which made the scale of e-commerce in China expand rapidly. E-commerce recommendation system provides users with commodity information and suggestions on the basis of understanding and learning customers' needs and preferences, recommends products that may be of interest to users, and helps users complete the purchase process. Collaborative filtering is the most widely used and successful recommendation technology in the recommendation system. However, with the increase of the number of users and commodities in the e-commerce system, the time spent searching the nearest neighbor of the target user in the whole user space also increases sharply, which leads to the decline of system performance. In this paper, a cooperative recommendation implementation method based on user clustering is proposed. Users are clustered based on their scores of commodity categories, and only users' nearest neighbors are searched in the categories to which they belong, so as to search as many nearest neighbors as possible in as little user space as possible.

With the help of network technologies such as audio and video transmission, image recognition processing and data collaboration, it records the video signals, electronic equipment signals, audio signals of teachers and students, and transmits them in real-time through the network to simulate the real course environment. This article takes the online courses of Chinese universities as the background, and focuses on the interactive ritual chain in the online courses. Research has found that a good online course helps to form a stable teacher-student interaction, so that both parties can gain attention and respect. Simultaneously, the suppression of power, the restriction of formalization, and the imbalance of symbolic capital will affect the participation of teachers and students in interactive rituals to a certain extent. Creating a good teacher-student interaction situation and integrating informational and humanized interactive processes will help promote college online teaching effects.

To understand the efficacy of regional innovative policies, we proposed the dynamic two-stage slacks-based measure (SBM) model with carry-over and intermediate variables, highlighting the importance of the status of invention patent, as granted patent and patent in force, to measure the overall innovative performance for the purposed of regional innovative development, which makes significant difference to previous studies on modelling setting. Using data of 30 provincial administration regions in China for the period of 2011-2017, the average regional innovative system performance is deemed as 0.5858 and we postulated that the difference of commercialization performance among three main areas should be pay attention, because the average performance of commercialization stage in the east area is obviously better than that the west and central areas. Based on this finding, we propose several policy suggestions as the provincial and central government who should be put more efforts on innovative competitiveness, as enhancing the quality and quantity of invention patents and the market-oriented to guild the direction for the R&D stage.

In addition to compensation level/amount adopted in related researches under Chinese context, executive compensation incentives involve the incentive intensity measured by sensitivity between compensation and performance. It is found that executive compensation incentives have significant impacts on power-induced implicit corruption. Specifically, increasing the performance-based compensation incentive intensity may curb power-induced implicit corruption. However, merely raising the compensation is effective only when executives are in low-pay level. Our study provides an important internal governance perspective for implicit corruption based on the executive compensation incentive mechanism.

However, in recent years, against the background of anti-globalization, many countries have set up green trade barriers of different degrees for vegetable import. Trade gravity model is a theoretical hypothesis established by Newton's gravitation formula, which is used by economists to explain the problem of determining the flow of trade within a sector. This paper uses the time series data from 2000 to 2019, modifies the gravity model, and uses STATA 12.0 for regression to analyze the impact of the green trade barrier degree of China's main vegetable trade companies on China, and analyzes the changing trend of this influence. Based on the analysis results, we can see the influence of green trade barriers on China's vegetable products is expected to be further reduced, especially after the signing of the RCEP, so China's export will increase, but China's vegetable export direction is going to focus on the east area in the short term. We suggest that China comply with international standards, improve the supply chain and logistics system of agricultural products, enhance the international competitiveness of vegetable products and diversify trade directions.

This paper examines the influencing factors of stock price volatility from the perspective of CSR information disclosure. This study takes Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2019 as samples, and constructs panel data models to test the impact of CSR information disclosure on stock return volatility. The results show that CSR disclosure is negatively related with stock return volatility. It indicates that the disclosures of corporate social responsibility by corporations significantly reduce the risk of future stock volatility in the financial markets. After conducting robustness tests, the above conclusion still holds. This paper not only enriches the influencing factors of stock return volatility, but also provides new empirical support for the prevention of stock volatility risk.

The further keywords-in-context (KWIC) analysis of the abstracts of the dataset clarifies the seemingly-interchangeable notions of ldquoself-trackingrdquo and ldquoquantified-selfrdquo: While ldquoself-trackingrdquo refers to more general activities, practices, technologies, and applications of keeping tracks, ldquoquantified-selfrdquo refers to the more conscious efforts and meaning-making outcomes of the self-tracking activities. Such clarification, along with the keyword network analysis, suggests that self-tracking has become a specific and major type of datafication of human conditions or existence and that quantified-self is the construction of self through such datafication. A more integrated conceptual framework is needed for future research to better understand what amounts to meaningful datafication of human conditions and existence, thereby helping researchers and designers to discern the classic notions of health, wellness, and happiness for better research and design outcomes.

Bank branches face the pressure of rising operating costs, declining profits, and being gradually replaced by online services. Under the smart economic trend, bank branches are facing significant transforming and upgrading. Branches will gradually transform their roles from traditional business transaction centers to product marketing and customer experience centers. The intelligent upgrading and transformation of branches play an essential role in accelerating the process. In this paper, our research focuses on user experience in the smart branch and adjust with the smart society development trend. We study smart diversions' pre-processing at smart branches, establish smart queuing models, and mobile appointment systems to control the queue. We compare the smart model with the traditional under the bank's virtual simulation system. Use customer waiting time for service and employee work intensity as essential indicators of the queuing model. The simulation results show that the branch uses intelligent distribution is much more efficient than the traditional one. Customer experience and service efficiency are greatly improved.

At present, self-tracking products with the dashboard as the main interface face challenges in negative user experience and high abandon. In this paper, we try to improve the user experience of such technologies by paying more attention to the role of the user's emotions on the visualization and enhance their willingness to continue to use. Based on our previous study on people-centered self-tracking system design, we think the avatars should be a better choice than dashboards of self-tracking technologies. In order to detect whether avatars can bring more positive emotions than the dashboards, and to reduce abandon, we designed and implemented three phases of usability testing: a questionnaire of popular self-tracking applications in the market, a self-tracking product emotional research based on avatar and dashboards, and a questionnaire based on self-tracking APP prototype with avatar template. Through these usability testing, we obtained results that users are more tend to adopt the avatar one. This paper then proposed results that 9 emotions are significantly different when using these two different interface designs of self-tracking visualization. With such results of research, two implication for principles of sustainable interaction design of self-tracking applications had been proposed in this paper as 1) Understandability; 2) Performance optimizations. We hope to provide a new form of visualization for the interface design of self-tracking technology and complement usability research results of such design.

The rapid development of information technology has a significant impact on various fields. Driven by information technology, vocational training and education also enjoy the dividend brought by the development of information technology. In this context, vocational training provides more workers with endless opportunities, promotes the development of the labor market, and brings help to the wage problem of young people, especially some children. At the same time, vocational training is closely related to employment and education, which has brought certain changes to the youth and the labor market. Moreover, the state's attention to vocational training is also increasing, and vocational training is of great significance to the transformation of employment and education. However, there is a gap in the bibliometric analysis of this topic. Based on 694 articles retrieved from the web of science database from 1950 to 2020, this paper mainly reviews the highly cited literature on "vocational training", "employment", "education", "Youth", "labor market". By using big data analysis technology and visualization software, the author's key points such as keywords, main research institutions, countries, and publication sources are analyzed in detail. This paper makes a contribution to the literature of vocational training, employment, and education from the perspective of scientific measurement, to understand the impact of vocational training, education, and employment on youth and the labor market.

New technologies such as the knowledge map and machine learning brought by the intelligent Internet have greatly reduced the threshold for online personalized learning, and various online education platforms have also added elements of personalized learning to the services provided. However, most of the existing online personalized learning is limited to the personalization of learning topics, and there is a lack of personalization in terms of learning content, learning style, and learning experience. Therefore, this article uses intelligent Internet as the technical background and user experience as the research objects to build a design that meets the needs of the user's personalized learning experience. Finally, by redesigning the course modules of the Chaoxing Online Teaching Platform and comparing the effectiveness of the two design strategies, the experimental results show that the personalized learning experience design based on the intelligent Internet technology proposed in this paper is conducive to stimulating the curiosity of learning objects.

Therefore, using design thinking and system thinking to guide both digital transformation and green transformation gains more significance under such circumstances. Still, there is no systematic review of how user experience advances green and digital transformation. The purpose of the article is to provide a cross-disciplinary groundwork of user experience design related to green and digital transformation. User experience certainly occurs at every stage of a digital project so that both the user and service producer can refer to the result of this literature review and build more contributions upon it. This systematic review of user experience design literature on the topic has summarized the annual trends since 1995, main research disciplines, and publication outlets based on a scientometric analysis of 250 articles collected from the Web of Science database. Future research can build upon the preliminary findings here for the methodological, information, and research need for tracking the development of user experience design that advances digital transformation.

This research takes Guangzhou's higher vocational tourism teachers as the main body of research. The interview method was used to obtain relevant information and data. Through data analysis and comparison, two main problems were found: From the perspective of teachers, teachers' attention to information literacy is mainly in the use of information technology, but not enough attention to basic knowledge, information ethics, etc.; the level of information technology skills of teachers is not high. From a school perspective, the school lacks enough attention to teacher information literacy, lack of regular training of information technology skills, and lack of relevant information technology hardware. In this regard, this research proposes corresponding countermeasures: popularize the application of teaching information technology; improve teacher information literacy, develop teacher teaching information technology ability training; formulate higher vocational teacher information literacy evaluation standards, and include teacher information literacy into the teacher assessment system.

The most direct algorithm is to detect the position between two objects in the scene. However, due to the complexity of the virtual reality scene, this most direct detection algorithm cannot meet the real-time requirements of the role interaction in the virtual reality scene. Therefore, aiming at the collision detection problem in the virtual reality scene, an improved OBB level bounding box algorithm is proposed, which uses the hierarchical construction of the bounding tree to delete the nodes that are not added, and improves the accuracy of collision detection in the scene. Finally, through the performance and function test of the collision module in the system, the result shows that the system has achieved the expected effect, has certain practicability, and has certain reference and reference significance for the collision detection problem.

In recent years, artificial intelligence technology has been applied in the field of garbage classification, which provides a convenient means for garbage classification. However, technological innovation can only alleviate the accumulated total amount of garbage, and finding the source of garbage generation is the key to solve the problem. Therefore, based on the theory of planned behavior, A-B-C theory and interpersonal behavior theory, from the policy level, the social level and the individual level, this paper puts forward some suggestions, it is composed of government, society, individual and other organizations, and puts forward the corresponding research hypotheses. Through interviewing and questionnaire survey in Guangzhou, the sample data are collected, and then regression analysis and structural equation model analysis are used to obtain the influence degree value of residents' attitude towards garbage classification, subjective norms, perceived behavior control, situational factors, and government legal regulation on residents' living garbage classification willingness. The results show that residents' attitude towards domestic waste classification is significant and the government's legal control factors are the key factors affecting the residents' willingness of garbage classification.

We construct an evaluation framework with a dynamic two-stage model with serial connection. The major difference between this paper and previous literatures is the assumption of installed capacity, defined as a carry-over linking between two consecutive terms. The empirical result of the average regional sustainable development performance is 0.3487 for 2012-2017, due to lower average performance in the electricity portfolio stage than that in the energy productivity stage. The results from the model suggests that the provincial and central government should be put more efforts in the electricity portfolio, such as raising the zero-carbon capacity, to mitigate CO2 emission.

However, this kind of autonomous learning lacks systematic supervision and management to the learners. Therefore, the design of an effective mixed teaching model is the premise to ensure the learning effect. Based on the theory of deep learning and combining the characteristics of MOOC and SPOC, this paper designs a mixed teaching model of deep learning based on ldquoMOOC+SPOCrdquo environment, which not only makes full use of the characteristics of information resources, but also retains the advantages of traditional course teaching. The effectiveness of this model is proved by the author's teaching practice and questionnaire analysis, which is helpful to improve the quality of information-based subject teaching in colleges and universities.

In China, online open courses are open to all learners on the platform of major portals. Due to the increasing number of online courses, it is increasingly difficult for learners to find the content they are interested in on the website. In addition, the traditional collaborative filtering has the problems of sparse data, cold start, and low accuracy of recommendation results, etc. Therefore, the personalized recommendation system studied in this paper adds the collaborative filtering recommendation technology of user and project attributes. The recommendation system can actively discover the interest of learners according to their behavior characteristics, and provide them with online learning resources of interest, and improve the accuracy of the recommendation results by improving the collaborative filtering algorithm. In this paper, personalized recommendation technology is applied to online course website, aiming at providing personalized, automated and intelligent recommendation system for online learners.

The development of big data not only represents huge amount of data, advanced information technology and huge business opportunities, but also is an effective method to solve problems, transform the world and explore new ideas and scientific applications in the future. However, big data in economic development does not mean that it can replace all the rational thinking of social problems. The logic of scientific development cannot be annihilated in the mass data. In this era of rapid development of intelligent hardware, an important problem for application developers is how to find the delicate balance between power, coverage, transmission rate and cost. Enterprise organizations can use relevant data and analysis to help them reduce costs, improve efficiency, develop new products and make more informed business decisions.

And with the rapid development of AI and network technology, the Blended Learning (BL) came into being as online self-learning has become an inevitable learning trend. BL is an ldquoonline + offlinerdquo learning that combines the advantages of online and traditional learning. This research explores the applicability of POA and BL in College Intensive Reading Course. Students' feedback and the teacher's reflection after one unit of teaching experiment show that: compared with traditional teaching methods of Intensive Reading lessons, this teaching mode combined with POA and BL is more effective, flexible and interesting, arousing students' enthusiasm for learning, cultivating students' abilities of language output, autonomous learning, group cooperation and critical thinking and etc. The new model of POA can effectively transform the input material from the received knowledge to the output knowledge by offering students the scenarios and task requirements and assessments to stimulate students' enthusiasm and creativity to complete the output task and assessment to a great extent. It improves the efficiency of English learning and promotes the comprehensive skills of college English majors. Meanwhile, BL can expand classroom resources and learning time and space, and the application of multi-modal media on the online learning platform also brings more fun and efficiency to learning and assessment. The combination of the two makes the teaching effect significant. Some difficulties and challenges are also discovered in implementation of POA and BL. Therefore, the joint efforts of the school and teachers are needed in the future teaching research and practice.

Without education, it is difficult to establish culture. Without culture, education will not be valued. Only by promoting cultural poverty alleviation and educational poverty alleviation as a whole, can we form a joint force to eliminate poverty culture and improve ideological, moral, scientific and cultural level. Only through high-level cultural poverty alleviation and educational poverty alleviation, can we really play the "supporting aspiration" of culture and the function of "supporting intelligence" to provide intellectual and human support for poverty-stricken areas to achieve industrial shaping and economic transformation, so as to achieve complete poverty alleviation. Therefore, Wish Magic Box will contact relevant educational institutions to conduct lectures and provide relevant support services.

When climate change has been shaping the cultural attitudes and values, it becomes also relevant for the very organizations to adopt practices that advance both human and sustainable development. Thus, creative and cultural sectors need strategies to navigate the increasing need of green and digital transformation. To date, little research has been conducted on this topic, and thus this exploratory bibliometric analysis aims to fill the gap by a systematic review of the relevant literature. Based on 991 articles, this paper outlines the main areas of discussions and issues as well as the opportunities and challenges for research and policy innovations. The findings have revealed the significance of tourism, sustainability and Internet in the state-of-art literature, thereby highlighting the need for an integrated approach to green and digital transformation for creative and cultural industries. Future research can be conducted across different creative and cultural sectors, so as to allow researchers to generalize and construct the notion of smart and sustainable cultural consumption and production (SCP) as the timely and relevant contribution to the wider sustainable SCP literature.

However, since the differences in policy, culture, regular, and social systems among different countries and areas exist, the stake of credit has become a challenge for the development of cross-border e-commerce. The big data produced by these institutions are becoming the focus of related research. By utilizing the data rationally, enterprises can skillfully avoid the risk and reach a better development. In this paper, a credit assessment indicator system to solve the credit challenges of cross-border e-commerce of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Guangdong was proposed. Furthermore, a rational credit stake assessment model was established by using the computational method of hierarchical analysis to determine the weight of various indicators. The validation of the proposed model was assessed by an evaluation method based on the fuzzy system in the computer field. The model provides a firm ground for cross-border e-commerce enterprises to make policies to reduce or even avoid loss when facing credit risk.

The construction of a monitoring system and data collection are the key foundations for the management of emergencies. Based on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Internet of Things, an integrated data collection platform of the ground for environmental events is built. Firstly, a scheme with a high load and heavy wheelbase is selected to construct the UAV node delivery system. Secondly, the data aggregation UAV subsystem is constructed by taking the coping measures of the high-endurance UAV. Thirdly, the nodes of the ground monitoring system are designed to scatter the sensing nodes by clustering, which forms a layer of the cluster tree emergency monitoring network and collects the data. Finally, the feasibility of the design method is verified through practical experiments.

With the development of economy, recruitment channels are becoming more and more diversified. Enterprises will choose recruitment channels according to various reasons to recruit suitable candidates for the vacant positions of the enterprise. However, after finding the suitable people, how to keep them or hire them. After the recruitment of employees, whether the performance of employees is related to the recruitment channels has an important reference role for the selection of human resources. We use AI technology to measure the performance of employees through the three dimensions of subjective initiative, job satisfaction and job self dedication. Therefore, it has theoretical and practical value for improving the recruitment effect and contribution.

Therefore, migrations and inner-city activities are reducing dramatically in the lockdown period. In this study, we explore the correlation between human activity and air pollution by studying the changes of air pollutants between 2019 and 2020. Besides, we investigate the relationships between migration strength and air pollutants by establishing a migration-air-pollutant network. Experimental results demonstrate that the changes in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2concentration in 2020 are smaller than in 2019. However, the correlation between city activities and most air pollutants is not apparent. Expect the concentration of PM2.5 in Wuhan and the concentration of SO2in Beijing, while the migration strength is not relative to air pollutants.

However, with the development of internet and the vast amounts of users, there is plenty of useless information in internet forum data, especially during emergency. This not only increases the load for the subsequent data processing, but also influences the efficiency and accuracy of public opinion analysis. As a result, the useless data is harmful for the internet public opinion guidance for emergencies. Therefore, in view of internet forum text data of emergency events, in this work, we propose an information filtering mechanism of internet forum based on bilayer long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network. First, we propose a text information classification model based on LSTM neural network and related mechanism. Then, we evaluate the proposed mechanism by using the practical internet forums. The experimental results and analysis reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the textual information quality as well as the accuracy.

This paper measures the regional agglomeration, enterprise agglomeration and regional agglomeration structure of the logistics industry in the Pearl River Delta from 2013 to 2019, and uses the gray correlation model to analyze the relationship between transportation, storage and postal industry, wholesale and retail industry and economic development. The study found that the logistics industry in the Pearl River Delta at this stage has not formed a reasonable agglomeration structure, whether it is transportation, storage and postal industry, or wholesale and retail. The agglomeration and structure of the transportation, storage, and postal industries in the Pearl River Delta are better than those of wholesale and retail, but the agglomeration of wholesale and retail has a greater impact on economic development. Full attention should be paid to the promotion of regional economic development by the agglomeration of the logistics industry, the positive externalities of the agglomeration of the logistics industry should be brought into play, the supply-side reform of the logistics industry should be actively promoted, and differentiated guidance strategies should be adopted for the transportation, warehousing and postal industries, and wholesale and retail industries.

Sci. (Switzerland)	730 (10 pp.)	730 (10 pp.)	730 (10 pp.)								English	Generalized multi-protocol label-switching (GMPLS) provides packet-switching with multiple speeds and quality-of-services (QoSs). Packet buffering in GMPLS reduces packet loss by resolving the conflicts between packets requesting for a common channel. Presently, due to the diversity of multimedia applications, enabling multiple services in networks has become necessary. In this paper, a family of codes known as composite maximal-length sequence (CMLS) codes is introduced into an optical buffering scheme based on code-switching. A given number of available CMLS codes is divided into several code subsets. The buffer selects an unused CMLS code from a code subset and assigns it to the incoming packet. When all codes in a specific subset have been distributed to the queued packets, a free CMLS code in another subset is chosen for the new arrival. To achieve multi-level buffering services, the partition scenario with a lower subset number but with a higher number of codes in an individual subset is used as a code-assigning method for buffering high-QoS users. A two-level buffering system is demonstrated by examining the QoS of each class in terms of packet-dropping probability (PDP). The results show that different levels of PDPs can be effectively supported by a common buffer architecture.

To understand the efficacy of regional sustainable policies, we proposed a dynamic, two-stage, slacks-based measure (SBM) model with carry-over and intermediate variables, highlighting the importance of an electricity portfolio,to measure overall energy performance for the purpose of regional sustainable development. In this unified linear programming framework with intertemporal evaluation, we estimated the effects of a clean electricity supply by the abatement of CO2emissions and the gain of economic growth. The results can be used as a reference for decision makers to shape regional sustainable development policies. Using data of 30 provincial administration regions in China for the period of 2012-2017, we postulate that the lower energy performance of the Chinese regional economic system for sustainable development may be attributed to a lower electricity portfolio performance. We then postulate that investment in low-carbon energy infrastructure can combat CO2emissions, and is also a major driving force in the regional economic growth.

Electronics	2020	March	9	3		Electronics (Switzerland)	505 (18 pp.)	505 (18 pp.)	505 (18 pp.)								English	Due to the increasing consumption of food products and demand for food quality and safety, most food processing facilities in the United States utilize machines to automate their processes, such as cleaning, inspection and grading, packing, storing, and shipping. Machine vision technology has been a proven solution for inspection and grading of food products since the late 1980s. The remaining challenges, especially for small to midsize facilities, include the system and operating costs, demand for high-skilled workers for complicated configuration and operation and, in some cases, unsatisfactory results. This paper focuses on the development of an embedded solution with learning capability to alleviate these challenges. Three simple application cases are included to demonstrate the operation of this unique solution. Two datasets of more challenging cases were created to analyze and demonstrate the performance of our visual inspection algorithm. One dataset includes infrared images of Medjool dates of four levels of skin delamination for surface quality grading. The other one consists of grayscale images of oysters with varying shape for shape quality evaluation. Our algorithm achieved a grading accuracy of 95.0% on the date dataset and 98.6% on the oyster dataset, both easily surpassed manual grading, which constantly faces the challenges of human fatigue or other distractions. Details of the design and functions of our smart camera and our simple visual inspection algorithm are discussed in this paper.

Lett. (USA)	2020	2023	2020-3								English	Optical buffering is one of the essential functions in optical packet switching (OPS) network. This letter employs optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) signals of spectral-amplitude-coding (SAC) in a packet-buffering architecture. In the proposed scheme, the original OCDMA label of the incoming packet is identified and converted to a new label by a code-switching system. As multiple packets overlap in the time domain in a single device, SAC is adopted for packet encoding to avoid multiple access interference (MAI). The concepts of queuing system and Gaussian approximation are employed to model the buffer architecture. Simulations were conducted to demonstrate the tradeoff between packet dropping probability and the signal variations in the label identification process. The buffering performance in terms of bit-error rate (BER) is examined. The results show SAC labels perform well on packet buffering.

In the field of environmental science, how to forecast PM2.5 is an important topic. We construct a previous 24-hour indicator before the predicted point to construct an enhanced dataset for PM2.5 concentration prediction. However, with a large scale of features, the performances of fundamental neural networks are not stable or accurate enough. As a result, an ensemble GRU (Gate Recurrent Unit) neural network is proposed for short-term PM2.5 prediction. This approach can improve accuracy while maintaining stability by combining the outputs after varying training. In this study, a dataset, which recording 6 indicators (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, SO2) for more than 20,000 hours in Shenzhen, is adopted to evaluate the proposed approach. Experimental results indicate that the proposed ensemble GRU model provides the lowest scores in MSE, RMSE criteria, and the best average-results in R2, MSE, RMSE scores.

J	INSPEC:19283456	Journal Paper			Noise-tolerant and finite-time convergent ZNN models for dynamic matrix Moore-Penrose inversion	Zhiguo Tan; Lin Xiao; Siyuan Chen; Xuanjiao Lv						IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	2020	March	16	3		IEEE Trans. Ind. Inform. (USA)	1591	1601	1591-601								English	Dynamic (or say, time-varying) problems have been a hot spot of research recently. As a general form of matrix inverse, dynamic Moore-Penrose inverse solving has received more and more attention owing to its broad applications. The approaches based on neural networks have become a popular solution to various dynamic matrix-related problems including dynamic Moore-Penrose inverse. However, existing neural models either only achieve infinitetime instead of finite-time convergence, or are sensitive to noises. Therefore, finite-time convergent neural model, which is simultaneously capable of addressing the noises, is desperately needed for dynamic Moore-Penrose inverse solving. To do that, in this paper, a novel evolution formula is designed based on the widely investigated Zhang neural network (ZNN). Accordingly, two modified ZNN models (MZNN), namely MZNN-R and MZNN-L models, are proposed and analyzed for the right and left dynamic Moore-Penrose inversion of full-rank matrices, respectively. In addition to providing detailed theoretical analyses on the desired finite-time convergence and noise-depression properties of the proposed two models, we also perform two numerical examples for further verification. Furthermore, to illustrate the potential of MZNN models in practical applications, two path-tracking control examples are also presented via a two-dimensional planar three-link and a three-dimensional Kinova Jaco2redundant robot manipulator. The feasibility, extraordinary efficacy, and superiority of the proposed MZNN models for dynamic Moore-Penrose inverse solving are corroborated by both theoretical results and simulation observations.

J. Inf. Technol. Decis. Mak. (Singapore)	1037	1069	1037-69								English	The complex problem of risk factors has greatly increased globally due to the quick ever-changing digital era. The development of suitable techniques for facilitating the performance of risk management in the financial service domain is thus an urgent task, especially in today's highly turbulent business environment. The development of such techniques involves many factors like the classical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, but too many factors surrounding the users will confuse them and lead to improper judgments. To deal with this critical task, this study proposes a fusion multiple rule-based decision-making (MRDM) approach that integrates a rule-based technique [i.e., the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST) with particle swarm optimization (PSO)] into MCDM (i.e., DEMATEL, DANP, and modified-VIKOR) techniques that can help decision makers choose the optimal model necessary for achieving aspiration-level effects in a risk control strategy. The results indicate that the improvement priority, which runs in the order as (a) AI algorithm model, (c) AI regulatory and compliance, (d) AI conduct, and (b) AI technology based on the magnitude of the impact, can effectively improve the performance of AI-driven risk management for financial service firms.

Appl. (Germany)	4915	4928	4915-28								English	At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic has triggered global public health concern. Here, a model integrating the daily intercity migration network, which constructed from real-world migration records and the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, is utilized to predict the epidemic spreading of the COVID-19 in more than 300 cities in China. However, the model has more than 1800 unknown parameters, which is a challenging task to estimate all unknown parameters from historical data within a reasonable computation time. In this article, we proposed a pseudocoevolutionary simulated annealing (SA) algorithm for identifying these unknown parameters. The large volume of unknown parameters of this model is optimized through three procedures co-adapted SA-based optimization processes, respectively. Our results confirm that the proposed method is both efficient and robust. Then, we use the identified model to predict the trends of the epidemic spreading of the COVID-19 in these cities. We find that the number of infections in most cities in China has reached their peak from February 29, 2020, to March 15, 2020. For most cities outside Hubei province, the total number of infected individuals would be less than 100, while for most cities in Hubei province (exclude Wuhan), the total number of infected individuals would be less than 3000.

Compared with the traditional offline business, E-commerce business eliminates geographical limitations by allowing consumers to purchase anywhere. Additionally, E-commerce only requires a web-based platform to start a business, resulting in a lower investment or business capital. Based on more than 75,000,000 transactions of one E-commerce company from January 2013 to June 2019, we analyze the economic impact of the holiday season, the relationship between price and sales, etc. Furthermore, we utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to predict the sales of products.

J. Inf. Syst. Serv. Sect. (USA)	1	18	1-18								English	In 2018, the number of internet users in Taiwan reached 18.66 million. The online rate was 79.2%, which was 0.4% higher than that in 2017. Moreover, the annual growth rate of Taiwan's online shopping market is double digits, suggesting the rapid expansion of online shops and the popular trend in online shopping. Managing a store on the internet platform offers many advantages, such as low operating cost, cheaper fees, greater sources of customers, and keyword marketing. As online shopping becomes prevalent in Taiwan, online shops are considered effective sales channels. Among the online shops, there are many small organic shops operated by farmers, as well as chain organic stores. However, researches on Taiwan's online purchase and sales of organic agricultural products (vegetables and fruits) are very sparse. The subjects were mostly urban women, who are white-collar workers, have middle to upper income levels, a high level of education, and are highly frequent internet shoppers. The findings indicate that in the booming online shopping market, urban women's attitude and perceived behavioral control positively, affect their intention to buy organic agricultural products (vegetables and fruits) online. Chain stores and farmers should consider internet marketing as an important sales channel targeting urban women.

The development of modern service industry plays a very important role in industrial transformation. The emergence of AI technology improves the effectiveness of data mining, and more and more scholars suggest a series of optimization methods to lift the prediction ability. In this study, tangent fruit fly optimization algorithm with step adjust (TANSAFOA) is proposed and it is used to optimize multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) to construct a prediction model of business performance.

This paper presents an intelligent three-dimensional wide-area water quality monitoring and online analysis system. The proposed system is composed of an automatic cruise intelligent unmanned surface vehicle (USV), a water quality monitoring system (WQMS), and a water quality analysis algorithm. An automatic positioning cruising system is constructed for the USV. The WQMS consists of a series of low-power water quality detecting sensors and a lifting device that can collect the water quality monitoring data at different water depths. These data are analyzed by the proposed water quality analysis algorithm based on the ensemble learning method to estimate the water quality level. Then, a real experiment is conducted in a lake to verify the feasibility of the proposed design. The experimental results obtained in real application demonstrate good performance and feasibility of the proposed monitoring system.

These steps rely on feature descriptors to match image features across sets of images. Previous work has shown that our SYnthetic BAsis (SYBA) feature descriptor can offer superior performance to other binary descriptors. This paper focused on various optimizations and hardware implementation of the newer and optimized version. The hardware implementation on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a high-throughput low-latency solution which is critical for applications such as high-speed object detection and tracking, stereo vision, visual odometry, structure from motion, and optical flow. We compared our solution to other hardware designs of binary descriptors. We demonstrated that our implementation of SYBA as a feature descriptor in hardware offered superior image feature matching performance and used fewer resources than most binary feature descriptor implementations.

Ind. Electron. (USA)	10065	10074	10065-74								English	This article presents an integrated power control strategy (IPCS) for a variable frequency speed regulation system, which consists of a back-to-back converter and a small film dc-link capacitor. Due to the lack of large-capacity energy storage components in the dc bus, there is a strong power coupling between the rectifier and the inverter. The dynamic response is limited and dc-link voltage oscillates because the traditional method controls rectification and inversion separately. The IPCS is proposed to achieve dynamic balance of the system power through synchronous control of the rectifier and inverter. High conversion efficiency guarantees the power balance of the rectifier and inverter meanwhile reduces the dc bus voltage ripple. To further reduce the dc-link voltage ripple and maintain the stability of the dc-link voltage under step changes of load, a virtual inertia control method is proposed, which consists of a virtual resistance control block and a virtual capacitor control block. As a result, the dc-link voltage ripple and the total harmonic distortion of the dc-link current can be improved. Simulations and experimental results are given to provide further validation of the proposed IPCS under different operating scenarios.

In this paper, we employ excess media coverage as a proxy for manipulated information dissemination. The raw momentum returns are negative across all degrees of manipulated information dissemination, but turn into significantly positive after controlling for risks. These outcomes hint that the manipulations of information dissemination contribute to price instabilities, so raw momentum returns are negative but turn into positive owing to risk adjustments. Moreover, we also discover that the stocks with high manipulated information dissemination exhibit big size characteristic and resist market risk well.

IEEE Access	2021	2021	9			IEEE Access (USA)	133746	133761	133746-133761								English	This paper presents an authentication scheme with recoverability based on Absolute moment block truncation coding (AMBTC). Previous works do not take into account characteristics of the AMBTC compressed codes. Therefore, the qualities of marked and recovered images are not satisfactory. In this paper, we generate the recovery codes according to block similarities. The recovery codes are scrambled and stored in the bitmaps of smooth blocks using Matrix encoding. The bits in the bitmap are flipped to obtain a set of authentication codes. The code that causes the least error is embedded into the quantization values using the adaptive pixel pair matching technique (APPM). For those complex blocks, the authentication codes are generated from the bitmaps, and are embedded into the quantization values. After authenticating, the tampered blocks are recovered by untampered ones with the same cluster information. Some blocks that cannot be recovered in the previous stage are recovered by using the Side match technique. The experimental results show that our method provides better image quality and recoverability than prior works.

In this market dominated by retail investors, we examine the momentum profits in 900 types of daily testing periods. We find prevalent price reversals in the long formation and holding periods in the Chinese A-share market. Compared to Goyal and Wahal (2015), Wang and Xie (2010), and Kang et al. (2002) who found no momentum, our novel finding from a daily basis is that the A-share market presents price momentum within the short formation and holding periods. We first test the momentum profits under different strengths of anxiety in the A-share market. The stocks held by the least anxious investors elicit the strongest price momentum, whereas the stocks held by the most anxious investors encounter much weaker price momentum in the A-share market. According to our empirical outcomes, the A-share market overall exhibits higher anxiety and weaker momentum, whereas the B-share market embodies milder anxiety and stronger momentum. From the results of single market and cross-market comparisons, the intrinsic anxiety of retail investors is an essential factor stimulating the Chinese stock market to be prone to price reversals.

Based on the transportation costs from the rescue center to the disaster site and the cost of setting up the rescue center, golden rescue timeis taken into account. The penalty cost caused by losing the golden rescue time is considered, thereby quantifying timeliness as another dimension of cost. The problem is solved using K-means clustering algorithm and fruit fly algorithm (FOA). With the purpose of minimizing the weighted sum of construction costs, transportation costs and penalty costs of emergency rescue centers, suitable location is selected for establishment of emergency rescue center. Finally, modified two algorithms (RWFOA and MFOA) are compared in optimization performance. The K-means clustering analysis and FOA are used to simplify and solve the original model, which can solve complex problems. In comparison between RWFOA and MFOA, the optimal value of MFOA is lower.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that air pollution kills several million people worldwide each year. Researchers from various areas and governments and enterprises have invested many resources in investigating and reducing air pollution. Air Quality Index (AQI) is one of the essential indexes indicating air quality or the level of air pollution. A new dataset, including hourly AQI information recorded by 1,615 observation sites covering China from 2015 to 2019, is constructed. Several methods, including linear model and state-of-art techniques, such as Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), are adopted to forecast hourly AQI. The performance of these techniques is evaluated, and experiments show that the BiLSTM gives the best performance.

Large-scale IoT poses a great challenge to data sensing and collection, especially outdoor large area monitoring IoT in some unfriendly environment. However, the traditional IoT data acquisition efficiency is low, terrain monitoring limitations, and other deficiencies. Therefore, we propose A solution for Data acquisition of large-scale outdoor IoT based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and dynamic clustering. Firstly, we review the data collection methods for IoT and wireless sensor networks and discuss the UAV-IoT. Secondly, a new large-scale data collection solution of IoT is constructed based on UAV and dynamical clustering. Finally, an experiment is set up, and the proposed solution is verified. The experiment results are showed that the solution can improve the efficiency of data collection.

As compared to GNN (gradient neural network) and the recently proposed ZNN (Zhang neural network) for the left or right Moore-Penrose inverse solving, our models are theoretically proven to possess superior global convergence performance. More importantly, the proposed NNN-R model is successfully applied to path-tracking control of a three-link planar robot manipulator. Illustrative examples well validate the theoretical analyses as well as demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed models, which are adopted and verified their effectiveness in kinematic control of a redundant manipulator, for real-time Moore-Penrose inverse solving.

Its opening has been accelerating. However, this market has plenty of shortcomings, some of which involve China's special corporate culture. Artificial manipulations in financial reports are prevalent, which gives rise to uncertainties of investments. We propose turnover, financial transparency, and media coverage in the discussion of Chinese momentum. In so doing, we investigate the reasons for price reversal. We find that portfolio with high turnover usually has high financial transparency but it easily encounters price reversal. By contrast, the portfolio with high media coverage is free of price reversal even if these stocks have relatively low transparency and turnover.

(Netherlands)	270	280	270-80								English	The existing probability based reversible authentication schemes for demosaiced images embed authentication codes into rebuilt components of image pixels. The original demosaiced image can be totally recovered if the marked image is unaltered. Although these schemes offer the goal of pixel-wise tamper detection, the generated authentication codes are irrelevant to the image pixels, causing some undetectable intentional alterations. The proposed method pre-processes the rebuilt components of demosaiced images and hashes them to generate authentication codes. With the guide of a randomly-generated reference table, authentication codes are embedded into the rebuilt components of demosaiced images. Since the distortions of image pixels are sensitive to the embedded authentication codes, the proposed method further alters the pre-processed pixels to generate a set of authentication codes. One of the authentication codes that minimizes the distortion is embedded to generate marked demosaiced images. The results show that the proposed method offers a better image quality than prior state-of-the-art works, and is capable of detecting a variety of tampering. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Specifically, because of the development of Big Data and AI digital technologies, it is now vital to investigate how such technologies can be integrated into the HCI design for better user experience. With the aim to systematically examine digital journalism research fronts for better HCI, a scientometric study has been conducted by analyzing 2156 articles on digital journalism, collected from the Web of Science (WoS) database, so as to critically evaluate the extant literature investigating such relationship between HCI and digital journalism for future research directions. By analyzing major disciplines, core publications, keywords, and key authors' ideas, this study found that the multidisciplinary knowledge surrounding digital journalism, especially top disciplines such as communication, computer science, information science & library science can be divided into four main categories: journalism and framing; interactivity; analytics and metrics; big data and transparency. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a better overall picture on the relationship between journalism and interaction design, thereby helping advancing both fields with preliminary but important findings.

Since no systematic review on social media research for intelligent HCI has been conducted, the article presents exploratory findings on a scientometric analysis of the literature at the intersections of social media and AI. By identifying and discussing the main and emerging disciplines and the related keywords from 2,443 articles along with more than 18,000 citations, the findings show that while Twitter and Facebook have been the main platforms for study, Chinese social media platforms emerge as new sites of research with the COVID-19. Also, sentiment analysis appears to be the most prominent research practices, with implications on the issues of privacy, misinformation, depression, and mental health). Four key dimensions of social media are summarized as foundations for the proposed research agenda for intelligent HCI that is not only smart, but also fair and inclusive.
