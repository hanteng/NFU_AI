J	32709224	Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Review	Effect of diabetes mellitus on survival in patients with gallbladder Cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.		Jing, Chen; Wang, Zhengyi; Fu, Xue		BMC cancer	20	1	689	2020	2020 Jul 24	English	0	1	BACKGROUND: Increasing evidences indicated that diabetes might increase the incidence of gallbladder cancer. However, no sufficient data has ever clarified the impact of diabetes on the survival of patients with gallbladder cancer.METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases through July 2019 in order to find sufficient eligible researches. The pooled hazard risks (HRs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with either fix-effects or random-effects model. Due to the low gallbladder cancer mortality in general population, the RRs and standard mortality ratios (SMRs) were considered the similar estimates of the HRs.RESULTS: Ten eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. Analysis of eight cohorts found that diabetes was closely associated with the mortality of gallbladder cancer (HR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.06-1.14; P<0.00001). However, the mortality in male diabetes patients was not higher than female patients (RR=1.08, 95%CI=0.57-2.04, P=0.80).CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that diabetes patients had a higher mortality of gallbladder cancer compared with non-diabetes.

J	34458220	Journal Article	The Homeless People in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Victims of the Strict Pandemic Control Measures of the Government.		Wang, Ying; Hua, Lei; Zou, Shuyun; Deng, Taofeng; Chen, Yongqi; Cao, Wanying; Wu, Chuhan; Zhou, Yujie; Zou, Hua		Frontiers in public health	9		679429	2021	2021 	English	5	5	Copyright © 2021 Wang, Hua, Zou, Deng, Chen, Cao, Wu, Zhou and Zou.Background: By implementing aggressive control measures, China has rapidly and effectively controlled the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the neglected homeless population may become victims of that perceived success. Due to political sensitivity, we know little about them. Aims: This study aimed to investigate how the pandemic and the pandemic control strategies of the government affected the lives of the homeless people in mainland China. Methods: A total of 103 eligible participants experiencing absolute homelessness were recruited from Guangzhou City during July and August 2020. Surveys measured demographic characteristics including health status, changes in daily living, and actions of the government toward the homeless during the pandemic. Sankey diagrams and ordered logit regression models were used to examine the impact on the homeless of inhumane government efforts to drive the homeless away. Qualitative materials were analyzed by using an inductive approach to provide more details. Results: First, the homeless people in Guangzhou tended to be male, aged 40 to 64 years, less well-educated, and they originated from outside Guangdong although they were living in the city center. Most had little connection with their families. After a long period of homelessness, almost half of the participants were in poor health with various conditions, which made them extremely vulnerable to COVID-19. Second, the pandemic caused a substantial decline in incomes of homeless people, had less of a negative impact on their food intake, and affected sleep time in different ways. Third, during the COVID-19 pandemic, humanitarian aid from local governments of China decreased, whereas inhumane efforts to drive the homeless away intensified. Fourth, quantitative models and qualitative materials demonstrate the devastating effect of the strict pandemic control strategy of the government on the lives of homeless people, which may further cause their health problems. Conclusion: This study for the first time illustrated the characteristic features of the street homeless population in mainland China and their living situation during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most importantly demonstrated the devastating effect of the strict pandemic control of the government, which has been considered a great success in previous studies, on lives of homeless people. Urgent measures should be taken to ensure the protection of the homeless population and prevent an impending humanitarian crisis.

Li, Xian-Wen; Zhu, Yu-Lin; Chen, Chu-Yan; Geng, Zhi-Juan; Li, Xiang-Yong; Ye, Ting-Ting; Mao, Xiao-Nan; Du, Fang		Scientific reports	10	1	4602	2020	2020 03 12	English	5	10	In this study, two chlorophyll A/B binding protein (CAB) genes (CsCP1 and CsCP2) in tea plant were cloned. The proteins encoded by these genes belong to the external or internal antenna proteins of PS II, respectively. They may be the targets of physiological regulation for tea leaf cell PS II because they all contain multiple functional domains and modifiable sites. The CAB gene family in the tea genome consists of 25 homologous genes. We measured the expression patterns of ten genes in the CsCP1 and CsCP2 subfamily under six different stresses. CsCP1 expression was inhibited in response to 6 kinds of stress; CsCP2 expression was slightly upregulated only after cold stress and ABA treatment. However, the expression levels of CSA016997 and CSA030476 were upregulated significantly in the six stresses. The results suggested that the 10 CAB genes may have different functions in tea leaves. Moreover, changes in the expression of the 10 genes under stress appear to be related to ABA- and MeJA-dependent signalling pathways, and their responses to MeJA treatment is faster than those to ABA. In addition, we introduced our experiences for cloning the genes in the context of complex genomes.

He, Yuting; Wang, Yichong; Chen, Xuefang; Huang, Hao; Deng, Jiankai; Chen, Peisong; Bin, Huang		Journal of clinical laboratory analysis	34	7	e23280	2020	2020 Jul (Epub 2020 Mar 13)	English	0	0	© 2020 The Authors. Journal of Clinical Laboratory Analysis published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.BACKGROUND: The Daan HCV RNA quantitative assay was a recently developed kit with high sensitivity for the detection of HCV RNA. We aimed to evaluate the analytical performance of the Daan HCV RNA quantitative assay and compare it with the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test, v2.0.METHOD: WHO HCV RNA standard, NIBSC 06/102 standard, and CLSI EP documents were used to evaluate the precision, accuracy, linearity, anti-interference ability, and cross-reactivity of the Daan HCV RNA quantitative assay. Overall 198 clinical serum specimens were used to make comparison between the Daan HCV RNA quantitative assay and the Roche Cobas test.RESULTS: The within-run precision (Swithin ), and total precision (Stotal ) for 6.11log IU/mL, 4.22log IU/mL, and 2.32log IU/mL HCV RNA were 0.13 and 0.15, 0.07 and 0.09, and 0.11 and 0.10, respectively. The linear range was 20-108 IU/mL, and the limit of detection was 15IU/mL. It did not display any interference with commonly encountered conditions and cross-reactivity with some common virus. A good agreement was observed between the Daan HCV RNA quantitative assay and the Roche Cobas test.CONCLUSION: The Daan HCV RNA quantitative assay has shown satisfactory performances and excellent agreement with COBAS HCV Quantitative Test on clinical specimens with lower cost, which provides an alternative choice for the diagnosis and monitoring of HCV infection in developing countries.

J	32414384	Letter	"Pairing assistance": the effective way to solve the breakdown of health services system caused by COVID-19 pandemic.		Chen, Tianxiang; Wang, Ying; Hua, Lei		International journal for equity in health	19	1	68	2020	2020 05 15	English	1	4	The most terrifying thing about pandemic could be the large number of patients running against the health service system, which causes a serious shortage of health resources, especially medical personnel. Plotting mortality and diagnosis rates against medical staff resources in 16 cities in Hubei Province, where the epidemic was initially concerned and the most severe, shows a significant negative correlation, indicating the critical role of medical staff resources in controlling epidemics. Nevertheless, it is difficult to ensure that there exist enough medical personnel in cities severely hit by the outbreak. China provides solutions by adopting nationwide "pairing assistance" measures with at least one province assisting one city to alleviate pressure in the most severe area. By plotting the number of patients receiving treatment against day, it is clear that implementing "pairing assistance" is a turning point in China's fight against epidemics.

J	33941157	Journal Article	Rational design and structure-based engineering of alkaline pectate lyase from Paenibacillus sp. 0602 to improve thermostability.		Zhou, Zhanping; Wang, Xiao		BMC biotechnology	21	1	32	2021	2021 05 03	English	7	8	BACKGROUND: Ramie degumming is often carried out at high temperatures; therefore, thermostable alkaline pectate lyase (PL) is beneficial for ramie degumming for industrial applications. Thermostable PLs are usually obtained by exploring new enzymes or reconstructing existing enzyme by rational design. Here, we improved the thermostability of an alkaline pectate lyase (PelN) from Paenibacillus sp. 0602 with rational design and structure-based engineering.RESULTS: From 26 mutants, two mutants of G241A and G241V showed a higher thermostability compared with the wild-type PL. The mutant K93I showed increasing specific activity at 45°C. Subsequently, we obtained combinational mutations (K93I/G241A) and found that their thermostability and specific activity improved simultaneously. The K93I/G241A mutant showed a half-life time of 15.9min longer at 60°C and a melting temperature of 1.6°C higher than those of the wild PL. The optimum temperature decreased remarkably from 67.5°C to 60°C, accompanied by a 57% decrease in Km compared with the Km value of the wild-type strain. Finally, we found that the intramolecular interaction in PelN was the source in the improvements of molecular properties by comparing the model structures. Rational design of PelN was performed by stabilizing the alpha-helices with high conservation and increasing the stability of the overall structure of the protein. Two engineering strategies were applied by decreasing the mutation energy calculated by Discovery Studio and predicting the free energy in the process of protein folding by the PoPMuSiC algorithm.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the K93I/G241A mutant was more suitable for industrial production than the wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the two forementioned strategies could be extended to reveal engineering of other kinds of industrial enzymes.		Tianjin Sinonocy Biological Technology Co.

For practicality, we sieve through previous researches to identify 20 factors (grouped into 4 Dimensions: Personal Dimension Teacher's Effectiveness Dimension, Campus Environment Dimension, and Daily Environment Dimension), which most likely correlated with the quality of the stay of mobile Chinese-speaking students in France. We adopt the DANP (DEMATEL-based ANP) model, i.e., combining the Decision Making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method and the Analysis Network Process (ANP), to construct the Influential Network Relation Maps, identifying the hierarchical structure among the factors and the dimensions. We find that the "Teacher's Effectiveness" is the most influential dimension to the other 3 dimension. Our research can provide more insights on the French educational system improvement, and help define a more effective policy strategy focus.

Zhou, Zhanping; Wang, Xiao		Scientific reports	11	1	15846	2021	2021 08 04	English	12	12	© 2021. The Author(s).Chitosanases can catalyze the release of chitooligosaccharides which have a number of medical applications. Therefore, Chitosanases are good candidates for large-scale enzymatic synthesis due to their favorable thermostability properties and high catalytic efficiency. To further improve the thermostability of a chitosanase from Bacillus sp. TS, which has a half-life of 5.32min, we mutated specific serine residues that we identified as potentially relevant through structure comparison with thermophilic CelA from Clostridium thermocellum. Out of a total of 15 mutants, three, namely S265G, S276A, and S347G, show higher thermostability. Their half-lives at 60°C were calculated as 34.57min, 36.79min and 7.2min. The Km values of S265G, S276A and S347G mutants show substrate binding ability comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme, while the S265G mutant displays a significant decrease of enzymatic activities. Additionally, we studied the synergistic effects of combined mutations, observing that all double mutants and the triple mutant are more stable than the wild-type enzyme and single mutants. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms which might give a reasonable explanation for the improved thermostability via comparative analysis of the resulting 3D structures.

Zhan, Choujun; Zheng, Yufan; Lai, Zhikang; Hao, Tianyong; Li, Bing		Neural computing & applications			1-14	2020	2020 Aug 17 (Epub 2020 Aug 17)	English	1	4	© Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2020.At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic has triggered global public health concern. Here, a model integrating the daily intercity migration network, which constructed from real-world migration records and the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, is utilized to predict the epidemic spreading of the COVID-19 in more than 300 cities in China. However, the model has more than 1800 unknown parameters, which is a challenging task to estimate all unknown parameters from historical data within a reasonable computation time. In this article, we proposed a pseudocoevolutionary simulated annealing (SA) algorithm for identifying these unknown parameters. The large volume of unknown parameters of this model is optimized through three procedures co-adapted SA-based optimization processes, respectively. Our results confirm that the proposed method is both efficient and robust. Then, we use the identified model to predict the trends of the epidemic spreading of the COVID-19 in these cities. We find that the number of infections in most cities in China has reached their peak from February 29, 2020, to March 15, 2020. For most cities outside Hubei province, the total number of infected individuals would be less than 100, while for most cities in Hubei province (exclude Wuhan), the total number of infected individuals would be less than 3000.

Although more than 300 alpha-thal mutations have been reported in the world, the mutation spectrum is still not comprehensive. In this study, a novel mutation (HBA1: c.349G>T) in a newborn (proband) was first found by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Subsequently, hematological analysis and thalassemia genetic testing were performed for the family members. The results showed that both the proband and her mother were heterozygotes for this novel mutation and presented abnormal hematological indices. Based on the features observed in clinical practice, this novel mutation was considered as a type of alpha-thal variation.

The present study aims to explore the theoretical underpinning of low participation in screening programs using the method of meta-analytic structural equation modeling. It was found that the health belief model is the most adopted theoretical framework. Moreover, the intended uptake of screening was positively predicted only by cues to action, health literacy, and perceived susceptibility. As a result, a health intention model, including the three significant variables, is proposed. The practical implications of the findings are that health communication campaigns should focus on enlightening and engaging the public through all necessary means to raise awareness and transfer knowledge in relation to screening procedures as well as cancers per se.

Daily intercity migration data for 367 cities in China were collected from Baidu Migration, a mobile-app based human migration tracking data system. Early outbreak data of infected, recovered and death cases from official source (from January 24 to February 16, 2020) were used for model fitting. The set of model parameters obtained from best data fitting using a constrained nonlinear optimisation procedure was used for estimation of the dynamics of epidemic spreading in the following months. The work was completed on February 19, 2020. Our results showed that the number of infections in most cities in China would peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively. Moreover, for most cities outside and within Hubei Province (except Wuhan), the total number of infected individuals is expected to be less than 300 and 4000, respectively.

J	33003588	Journal Article	MS Location Estimation Based on the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm.		Chen, Chien-Sheng; Huang, Jen-Fa; Huang, Nan-Chun; Chen, Kai-Sheng		Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)	20	19		2020	2020 Sep 29	English	1	1	With the mature technology of wireless communications, the function of estimating the mobile station (MS) position has become essential. Suppressing the bias resulting from non-line-of-sight (NLSO) scenarios is the main issue for a wireless location network. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, based on the depiction of bee swarm's foraging characteristics, is widely applied to solve optimization problems in several fields. Based on three measurements of time-of-arrival (TOA), an objective function is used to quantify the additional NLOS error on the MS positioning scheme. The ABC algorithm is adopted to locate the most precise MS location by minimizing the objective function value. The performance of the proposed positioning methods is verified under various error distributions through computer simulations. Meanwhile, the localization accuracy achieved by other existing methods is also investigated. According to the simulation results, accurate estimation of the MS position is derived and therefore the efficiency of the localization process is increased.

J	31284827	Journal Article	Defining compassionate nursing care.		Su, Jing Jing; Masika, Golden Mwakibo; Paguio, Jenniffer Torralba; Redding, Sharon R		Nursing ethics	27	2	480-493	2020	2020 Mar (Epub 2019 Jul 08)	English	3	13	BACKGROUND: Compassion has long been advocated as a fundamental element in nursing practice and education. However, defining and translating compassion into caring practice by nursing students who are new to the clinical practice environment as part of their educational journey remain unclear.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore how Chinese baccalaureate nursing students define and characterize compassionate care as they participate in their clinical practice.METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study design was used involving a semi-structured in-depth interview method and qualitative content analysis. Twenty senior year baccalaureate nursing students were interviewed during their clinical practicum experience at four teaching hospitals.ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Permission to conduct the study was received from the Institutional Review Boards and the participating hospitals.RESULTS: Baccalaureate nursing students defined and characterized compassionate care as a union of "empathy" related to a nurse's desire to "alleviate patients' suffering," "address individualized care needs," "use therapeutic communication," and "promote mutual benefits with patients." Students recognized that the "practice environment" was characterized by nurse leaders' interpersonal relations, role modeling by nurses and workloads which influenced the practice of compassionate care by nursing personnel.CONCLUSION: Compassionate care is crucial for patients, nurses, and students in their professional development as well as the development of the nursing profession. In order to provide compassionate care, a positive practice environment promoted by hospital administrators is needed. This also includes having an adequate workforce of nurses who can role model compassionate care to students in their preceptor role while meeting the needs of their patients.

Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before mid April, the end of March and the end of May 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city or region will be less than 0.01%, 0.5% and 0.5%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.

Hong, Wien; Li, Dan; Lou, Der-Chyuan; Zhou, Xiaoyu; Chang, Chien-Hung		PloS one	15	4	e0230997	2020	2020 	English	2	2	The existing tamper detection schemes for absolute moment block truncation coding (AMBTC) compressed images are able to detect the tampering. However, the marked image qualities of these schemes can be enhanced, and their authentication methods may fail to detect some special tampering. We propose a secure AMBTC tamper detection scheme that preserves high image fidelity with excellent detectability. In the proposed approach, a bit in bitmaps of AMBTC codes is sequentially toggled to generate a set of authentication codes. The one that causes the least distortion is embedded into the quantization levels with the guidance of a key-generated reference table (RT). Without the correct key, the same reference table cannot be constructed. Therefore, the proposed method is able to detect various kinds of malicious tampering, including those special tampering techniques designed for RT-based authentication schemes. The proposed method not only offers better image quality, but also provides an excellent and satisfactory detectability as compared with previous works.

J	32824328	Journal Article	Geometric Modelling for 3D Point Clouds of Elbow Joints in Piping Systems.		Chan, Ting On; Xia, Linyuan; Lichti, Derek D; Sun, Yeran; Wang, Jun; Jiang, Tao; Li, Qianxia		Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)	20	16		2020	2020 Aug 16	English	5	5	Pipe elbow joints exist in almost every piping system supporting many important applications such as clean water supply. However, spatial information of the elbow joints is rarely extracted and analyzed from observations such as point cloud data obtained from laser scanning due to lack of a complete geometric model that can be applied to different types of joints. In this paper, we proposed a novel geometric model and several model adaptions for typical elbow joints including the 90° and 45° types, which facilitates the use of 3D point clouds of the elbow joints collected from laser scanning. The model comprises translational, rotational, and dimensional parameters, which can be used not only for monitoring the joints' geometry but also other applications such as point cloud registrations. Both simulated and real datasets were used to verify the model, and two applications derived from the proposed model (point cloud registration and mounting bracket detection) were shown. The results of the geometric fitting of the simulated datasets suggest that the model can accurately recover the geometry of the joint with very low translational (0.3 mm) and rotational (0.064°) errors when ±0.02 m random errors were introduced to coordinates of a simulated 90° joint (with diameter equal to 0.2 m). The fitting of the real datasets suggests that the accuracy of the diameter estimate reaches 97.2%. The joint-based registration accuracy reaches sub-decimeter and sub-degree levels for the translational and rotational parameters, respectively.

Bai, Xueyuan; Zhang, Bo; He, Yuan; Hong, Danhong; Song, Shiming; Huang, Yingyan; Zhang, Tao		Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)	266	Pt 1	115117	2020	2020 Nov (Epub 2020 Jul 02)	English	11	40	Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Triclosan (TCS) and Triclocarbon (TCC) are chlorinated synthetic antimicrobial agents formaternal urinelated in quantities of consumer products. However, the biomonitoring of direct exposure reflection for fetuses are rare. In this study, we determine the concentrations of TCS and TCC in paired maternal serum, cord serum, maternal urine, and amniotic fluid samples collected from a cohort of 95 expecting mother-fetal pairs in Southern China. TCS and TCC are detected widely (detection rates: >76.9%) in maternal serum, cord serum, maternal urine, and amniotic fluid samples. TCS is found to be the predominant antimicrobial agent with median concentrations in maternal serum (1.5ng/mL) and cord serum (1.8ng/mL) that are one order of magnitude higher than those of tcc in maternal serum (0.085ng/mL) and cord serum (0.052ng/mL), respectively. Cord serum concentrations of tcs and tcc correlated well with the concentrations in maternal serum, which reflect the mothers' contribution to fetal exposure. The higher median ratio of cord serum/maternal serumTCS (0.95) compared to that of cord serum/maternal serumTCC (0.53) indicates high placental transmission ability of TCS. Moreover, the facility to penetrate the placental barrier and hard to depurate characteristics lead to the long residence of TCS in the fetal environment, causing great concern over the prenatal exposure risks during the critical window of fetal development. This study provides a novel contribution by increasing existing knowledge on the exposure assessment of TCS and TCC during pregnancy through the exploration of matched maternal-fetal samples.

The current study aimed to assess the various contributing and eliminating factors of maternal delivery at home in India. The reasons for not delivering at healthcare facilities were also explored.METHODS: The study used the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS)-4 (2015-2016) data from states and union territories of India for analysis. A national representative sample of 699,686 women of reproductive age group (15-49years) was used. Cross-tabulation and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.RESULTS: The prevalence of home delivery in India was 22%, among which 34% of women believed that institutional delivery was not a necessity. Financial constraints, lack of proper transportation facilities, non-accessibility of healthcare institutions and not getting permission from family members were the main reasons cited by the women for delivering at home. The proportion of home deliveries was much higher among women from more disadvantaged socioeconomic areas than women from less disadvantaged socioeconomic areas. Domestic violence and partner control were essential factors contributing to the prevalence of home delivery. However, the women who owned mobile phones and used a short message service (SMS) facility delivered at home less often.CONCLUSION: Policymakers should focus more on the women living in disadvantaged socioeconomic areas and other marginalised populations with less education and low economic levels to provide them with optimum delivery care utilisation. Strengthening of public healthcare facilities and more effective use of skilled birth attendents and their networking are essential steps. Electronic and economic empowerment of women should be emphasised to bring about a significant reduction in the proportion of home deliveries in India.

All rights reserved.Compassion is a core value of the nursing profession which enables nurses to empathize with and help alleviate patient suffering. Literature increasingly reports a lack of compassion in patient care by students and junior nurses; empirical knowledge regarding experiences of compassionate care among nursing students remains understudied. Student experiences in the clinical setting may influence their development of compassion competencies. This study explored the experiences of baccalaureate nursing students in gaining competencies to deliver compassionate care during their clinical practice year. A descriptive qualitative study using semi-structured in-depth interviews was conducted. Thematic analysis was employed, generating six themes. The first three themes depict positive aspects of compassion development, including 'gaining patient acceptance,' 'motivation for professional growth,' and 'establishing an emotional bond with patients.' On the other hand, the other three themes capture the barriers to compassionate care, 'distrust,' 'fear of harm due to violence,' and 'heavy workload.' The positive and negative experiences shared by students indicate that hospital and nursing administrators need to foster a positive practice environment and nursing instructors should become role models to encourage compassionate care.

Zhang, Bo; He, Yuan; Huang, Yingyan; Hong, Danhong; Yao, Yiming; Wang, Lei; Sun, Wenwen; Yang, Baoqin; Huang, Xiongfei; Song, Shiming; Bai, Xueyuan; Guo, Yuankai; Zhang, Tao; Sun, Hongwen		Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)	263	Pt A	114461	2020	2020 Aug (Epub 2020 Mar 31)	English	39	130	Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.With the phase out of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the composition profiles of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) in our living environment are unclear. In this study, 25 PFASs were analyzed in indoor dust samples collected from urban, industrial, and e-waste dismantling areas in China. PFOS alternatives, including 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) (median: 5.52ng/g) and 8:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (8:2 Cl-PFESA) (1.81ng/g), were frequently detected. By contrast, PFOA alternatives, such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HPFO-DA, Gen-X) and ammonium 4,8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoate (ADONA), were not found in any of the dust samples. As expected, all legacy PFASs were widely observed in indoor dust, and 4 PFAS precursors were also detected. Dust concentrations of 6:2 Cl-PFESA were strongly correlated (p<0.05) with those of 8:2 Cl-PFESA regardless of sampling sites. 6:2 Cl-PFESA was also significantly associated with that of PFOS in industrial and e-waste (p<0.01) areas. Association analysis suggested that the sources of PFOS and its alternatives are common or related. Although Cl-PFESA concentration was lower than that of PFOS (17.4ng/g), industrial areas had the highest 6:2 Cl-PFESA/PFOS ratio (0.63). Composition profiles of PFASs in the industrial area showed the forefront of fluorine change. Thus, the present findings suggested that Cl-PFESAs are widely used as PFOS alternatives in China, and high levels of human Cl-PFESA exposure are expected in the future. Short-chain PFASs (C4-C7) were the predominant PFASs found in dust samples, contributing to over 40% of total PFASs. Furthermore, perfluoro-1-butanesulfonate/PFOS and perfluoro-n-butanoic acid (PFBA)/PFOA ratios were 2.8 and 0.72, respectively. These findings suggested shifting to the short-chain PFASs in the environment in China. To the authors knowledge this is the first study to document the levels of 6:2 Cl-PFESA, 8:2 Cl-PFESA in indoor dust.

Monocytes are the principal immune cells for the production of inflammatory cytokines and contribute to inflammaging in the elderly. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we found that monocytes from aged individuals contained high levels of lipid droplets (LDs), and this increase was correlated with impaired fatty acid oxidation. Downregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha may be responsible for the pro-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes in aged individuals, as it was positively correlated with LD accumulation and increasing TNF-alpha concentration. Interestingly, interventions that result in PPAR-alpha upregulation, such as fenofibrate treatment, TNF-alpha neutralization, or calorie restriction, reversed the effect of aging on monocytes. Thus the downregulation of PPAR-alpha and LD levels in monocytes represents a novel biomarker for inflammaging. Furthermore, PPAR-alpha activation in the elderly may also alleviate long-term inflammaging, preventing the development of life-limiting chronic diseases.

Previous evidence suggests that puerarin, a phytoestrogen, exerts beneficial effects on cardiac function in patients with cardiac hypertrophy. In this study, we investigated whether puerarin couldprevent cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in ovariectomized, aortic-banded rats. Female SD rats subjected to bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) plus abdominal aortic constriction (AAC). The rats were treated withpuerarin (50mg·kg-1·d-1, ip) for 8 weeks. Then echocardiography was assessed, and the rats were sacrificed, their heart tissues were extracted and allocated for further experiments. We showed that puerarinadministration significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in AAC-treated OVX rats, which could be attributed to activation of PPARalpha/PPARgamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) pathway. Puerarinadministration significantly increased the expression of estrogen-related receptor alpha, nuclear respiratory factor 1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A in hearts.Moreover, puerarinadministrationregulated the expression of metabolic genes in AAC-treated OVX rats. Hypertrophic changes could be inducedin neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) in vitro by treatment with angiotensin II (Ang II, 1muM), which was attenuated by co-treatemnt withpuerarin (100muM). We further showed that puerarin decreased Ang II-induced accumulation of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and deletion of ATP, attenuated the Ang II-induced dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and improved the mitochondrial dysfunction in NRCM. Furthermore, addition of PPARalpha antagonist GW6471 (10muM) partially abolished the anti-hypertrophic effects and metabolic effects of puerarinin NRCM. In conclusion,puerarin prevents cardiac hypertrophy in AAC-treated OVX rats through activation of PPARalpha/PGC-1 pathway and regulation of energy metabolism remodeling. This may provide a new approach to prevent the development of heart failure in postmenopausal women.

Unfortunately, there are limited multi-center data on common viral respiratory infections in south China.METHODS: A total of 4403 nasal swabs were collected from children in 10 cities in Guangdong, China in 2019. Seven respiratory viruses, influenza A virus (IFA), influenza B virus (IFB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenoviruses (ADV) and parainfluenza virus types 1-3 (PIV1, PIV2 and PIV3), were detected by direct immunofluorescence antibody assay. The personal information and clinical characteristics were recorded and analyzed.RESULTS: The results showed that at least one virus was detected in 1099 (24.96%) samples. The detection rates of RSV, IFA, ADV, PIV3, PIV1 and PIV2 were 7.13% (314/4403), 5.31% (234/4403), 4.02% (177/4403), 3.04% (134/4403), 1.70% (75/4403) and 1.16% (51/4403), respectively. The detection rate of RSV was highest in 0-6-month-old children at 18.18% (106/583), while the detection rate of IFA was highest in 12-18-year-old children at 20.48% (17/83). The total detection rates in winter and spring were 35.67% (219/614) and 34.56% (403/1166), higher than those in summer, 17.41% (284/1631), and autumn, 19.46% (193/992).CONCLUSIONS: RSV and IFA were the main respiratory viruses in children. With increasing age the detection rate of RSV decreased in children, but the trends for the detection rates of IFA and IFB were the opposite. This study provided the viral etiology and epidemiology of pediatric patients with ARI in Guangdong, China.
