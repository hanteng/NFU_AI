AB Under the general trend of mobile Internet, more and more industries
   began to change from traditional business model to e-commerce, which
   made the scale of e-commerce in China expand rapidly. E-commerce
   recommendation system provides users with commodity information and
   suggestions on the basis of understanding and learning customers' needs
   and preferences, recommends products that may be of interest to users,
   and helps users complete the purchase process. Collaborative filtering
   is the most widely used and successful recommendation technology in the
   recommendation system. However, with the increase of the number of users
   and commodities in the e-commerce system, the time spent searching the
   nearest neighbor of the target user in the whole user space also
   increases sharply, which leads to the decline of system performance. In
   this paper, a cooperative recommendation implementation method based on
   user clustering is proposed. Users are clustered based on their scores
   of commodity categories, and only users' nearest neighbors are searched
   in the categories to which they belong, so as to search as many nearest
   neighbors as possible in as little user space as possible.

   promote the digital transformation with the help of the opportunity of
   the industrial Internet. As an important field of digital
   transformation, e-commerce has great potential in various industries,
   such as service advantages and marketing methods. At present, large
   e-commerce platforms (Alibaba, JD, etc.) have small achievements, but
   there are few studies on the integration of e-commerce AI changing the
   e-commerce model, especially the lack of systematic review of digital
   marketing and digital transformation. This paper mainly discusses the
   application of AI in e-commerce platforms to form a diversified new
   e-commerce model to guide the transformation of traditional e-commerce.
   Based on this, 156 articles were selected from the Web of Science (WoS)
   database to map co-word clustering and analyze their annual trends,
   topics, publication locations, etc. Using scientific metrology to
   demonstrate the possibility and practicability of the research content
   in related fields will help Business managers to master how intelligent
   technology can enable digital e-commerce, achieve digital transformation
   and sustainable development, and take reasonable measures accordingly.

AB In order to analyze the characteristics of innovative thinking ability
   of Chinese students who learn a foreign language (English, French,
   Japanese and other minority languages) as a second foreign language and
   accordingly establish a teaching mode, this paper takes foreign language
   majors in Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University as subjects to
   participate in a WTMF (Williams Innovative Thinking Ability Tendency
   Measurement Form) and a TCT (Test of Creative Thinking). The result
   shows that students have higher scores in curiosity, challenge and
   adventure but lower scores in imagination. On the other hand, they
   performed better in originality but normal in fluency and flexibility.
   Moreover, data of different genders, grades and foreign language majors
   shows consistency in fluency, flexibility, originality and creativity.
   Based on the above investigation and the important role PBL
   (Project-based Learning) has played in improving the cognitive ability
   which composes of thinking ability, the author designs a PBL cultivation
   mode by putting forward the thinking training methods into the process
   of PBL in order to make joint efforts to cultivate college students'
   innovative thinking ability.

AB The attitudes of developing countries for intellectual property rights
   (IPR) regulations and law enforcement are ambiguous. We seek to clarify
   this issue by structuring a model, simultaneously considering the IPR
   index and the strength of law enforcement of China in period 1996-2015.
   Firstly, the government of a developing country always holds the
   strictest attitude towards law enforcement. Secondary, the growing level
   of IPR leads to the decrease of the total welfare, but the decline of
   total welfare slows down. Third, the motivation of maximising total
   welfare induces the governments of developing countries to strengthen
   law enforcement. This provides internal motivation for development. The
   findings of this article show that developing countries have long-term
   internal motivations to improve their strength of IPR levels and law
   enforcement.

AB To help reduce pollution, the study proposes a novel approach, called
   conscious waste-sorting, and provides a theoretical framework based on
   the stimulus-individual-response (SOR) model. The structural
   relationship among environmental, personal, and behavioral factors is
   first proposed and then explored, which considers multiple influences
   including environmental pollution, mass media, social norms,
   self-monitoring, self-preference, self-efficacy, personal outcome
   expectation, and conscious waste-sorting. Then, the model is empirically
   analyzed using PLS structural equation modeling on a sample of Shanghai
   citizens collected from an online questionnaire survey. The results
   showed that social norms (beta = 0.387, p < 0.001) and self-monitoring
   (beta = 0.433, p < 0.001) had a positive impact on self-efficacy, which
   in turn, led to personal outcome expectation (beta = 0.221, p < 0.001)
   and conscious waste-sorting behavior (beta = 0.412, p < 0.001). Based on
   this observation, the study also develops strategies to strengthen the
   conscious waste-sorting behavior to protect the environment.

AB Background Increasing evidences indicated that diabetes might increase
   the incidence of gallbladder cancer. However, no sufficient data has
   ever clarified the impact of diabetes on the survival of patients with
   gallbladder cancer. Methods We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase,
   and the Cochrane Library databases through July 2019 in order to find
   sufficient eligible researches. The pooled hazard risks (HRs) and
   relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
   with either fix-effects or random-effects model. Due to the low
   gallbladder cancer mortality in general population, the RRs and standard
   mortality ratios (SMRs) were considered the similar estimates of the
   HRs. Results Ten eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis.
   Analysis of eight cohorts found that diabetes was closely associated
   with the mortality of gallbladder cancer (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.06-1.14;P
   < 0.00001). However, the mortality in male diabetes patients was not
   higher than female patients (RR = 1.08, 95%CI = 0.57-2.04,P = 0.80).
   Conclusions These findings indicated that diabetes patients had a higher
   mortality of gallbladder cancer compared with non-diabetes.

AB Evaluating effectiveness and impacts of higher education has been the
   central sites of observations for the field of educational assessment
   and professional accreditation, with various institutions providing
   accreditation services such as IEET, HEEACT, AACSB, ABET, etc. Given the
   advancement of digital technologies and digital economy applications, it
   is important to explore how such higher education evaluation can benefit
   from, and also account in, such digital advancement. In this paper, we
   conduct web crawling written in Python to systematically scan the Web of
   Science to retrieve the related literature. Based on 646 bibliographic
   data collected from the database, the findings show that the main
   contribution has been made by mostly the three main disciplines: science
   education, educational research, and engineering, the top journals such
   as International Journal of Engineering Education, the top keywords such
   as accreditation, assessment, quality assurance, outcomes, etc. The
   findings also reveal how such concerns have been discussed in relation
   to topics such as learning analytics, big data, sustainability, impacts,
   etc., that can be related to green and digital transformation. In
   conclusion, the overall mapping provides an initial roadmap for the
   practice of higher education assessment and accreditation to harness the
   potentials of digital technologies for green and digital transformation
   of higher education, including more inclusive notion of "impact" that
   includes sustainability and more human-centered notion of "outcomes"
   that focuses more on human development.

AB As service design thinking in public services has increasingly attracted
   attention for producing innovative solutions to wicked problems, its
   application promises great potentials in creating better and more
   responsive services. However, there is no comprehensive review on the
   topic specifically on service design for the fields of public health and
   public administration. Based on the current discussions on the value of
   design for public health and public administration, the paper presents a
   systematic literature review into the specific discussions on service
   design, with the purpose to provide better public service innovations,
   especially in the context of recognizing the human needs in the
   technological digital advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big
   Data, and Cloud Computing. The paper outlines the areas of applications,
   issues, and challenges for future research and policy innovations. By
   analyzing top keywords and authors from 529 articles, collected from the
   Web of Science database, the scientometric study reveals an emerging
   loose network of concepts and authors. Although the impact of such work
   remains limited at its early stage of development, the combination of
   both human-centered insights and system thinking processes at the
   organization levels, brought by the service design approach, has shown
   to tackle some of the wicked problems of public health and public
   administration. Future research and design workshops can be conducted to
   reinvigorate the notion of people-centered commitments for public
   service innovations, with societal relevance and scientific rigor.

   Their majority of topics are in the traditional business field and tend
   to be applied rather than technology or theory. Although "blockchain",
   "bitcoin", and "cryptocurrency" are correlative concepts, they are
   classified into different clusters, in which the red blockchain cluster
   is more capable of redefining financial services with digital resources.

AB The interface design of self-tracking technology still has a lot of room
   for improvement. At present, self-tracking products with the dashboard
   as the main interface face challenges in negative user experience and
   high abandon. In this paper, we try to improve the user experience of
   such technologies by paying more attention to the role of the user's
   emotions on the visualization and enhance their willingness to continue
   to use. Based on our previous study on people-centered self-tracking
   system design, we think the avatars should be a better choice than
   dashboards of self-tracking technologies. In order to detect whether
   avatars can bring more positive emotions than the dashboards, and to
   reduce abandon, we designed and implemented three phases of usability
   testing: a questionnaire of popular self-tracking applications in the
   market, a self-tracking product emotional research based on avatar and
   dashboards, and a questionnaire based on self-tracking APP prototype
   with avatar template. Through these usability testing, we obtained
   results that users are more tend to adopt the avatar one. This paper
   then proposed results that 9 emotions are significantly different when
   using these two different interface designs of self-tracking
   visualization. With such results of research, two implication for
   principles of sustainable interaction design of self-tracking
   applications had been proposed in this paper as 1) Understandability; 2)
   Performance optimizations. We hope to provide a new form of
   visualization for the interface design of self-tracking technology and
   complement usability research results of such design.

AB Corporate social responsibility (CSR) considers the sustainable
   development of environment and economy simultaneously, yet its impact on
   the stock market is controversial among academics. This paper examines
   the influencing factors of stock price volatility from the perspective
   of CSR information disclosure. This study takes Shanghai and Shenzhen
   A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2019 as samples, and constructs
   panel data models to test the impact of CSR information disclosure on
   stock return volatility. The results show that CSR disclosure is
   negatively related with stock return volatility. It indicates that the
   disclosures of corporate social responsibility by corporations
   significantly reduce the risk of future stock volatility in the
   financial markets. After conducting robustness tests, the above
   conclusion still holds. This paper not only enriches the influencing
   factors of stock return volatility, but also provides new empirical
   support for the prevention of stock volatility risk.

AB In order to solve the conflict between economic growth and environmental
   protection, the environmental impact assessment system used by western
   countries has been gradually introduced into China. It is a scientific
   and professional assessment system, which is regarded as the best tool
   to solve the conflict between economic growth and environmental
   protection. The implementation of the environmental impact assessment
   system can undoubtedly prevent some construction projects from having
   serious adverse impact on the environment. Through the comparison and
   selection of the feasibility schemes, the environmental impact of some
   construction projects can be minimized. Therefore, the environmental
   impact assessment system is regarded as an important pillar and
   effective legal system for the implementation of predictive
   environmental policy, which has attracted more and more attention in the
   world. In order to implement the strategy of sustainable development,
   prevent the adverse impact on the environment caused by the
   implementation of planning and construction projects, and promote the
   coordinated development of economy, society and environment, China has
   formulated the environmental impact assessment law. The law came into

   period of 2011-2017, the average regional innovative system performance
   is deemed as 0.5858 and we postulated that the difference of
   commercialization performance among three main areas should be pay
   attention, because the average performance of commercialization stage in
   the east area is obviously better than that the west and central areas.
   Based on this finding, we propose several policy suggestions as the
   provincial and central government who should be put more efforts on
   innovative competitiveness, as enhancing the quality and quantity of
   invention patents and the market-oriented to guild the direction for the
   R&D stage.

   education will not be valued. Only by promoting cultural poverty
   alleviation and educational poverty alleviation as a whole, can we form
   a joint force to eliminate poverty culture and improve ideological,

   "supporting intelligence" to provide intellectual and human support for
   poverty-stricken areas to achieve industrial shaping and economic

AB This study investigates whether and how executive compensation
   incentives improve the governance of corporate implicit corruption based
   on multiple linear regression model. In addition to compensation
   level/amount adopted in related researches under Chinese context,
   executive compensation incentives involve the incentive intensity
   measured by sensitivity between compensation and performance. It is
   found that executive compensation incentives have significant impacts on
   power-induced implicit corruption. Specifically, increasing the
   performance-based compensation incentive intensity may curb
   power-induced implicit corruption. However, merely raising the
   compensation is effective only when executives are in low-pay level. Our
   study provides an important internal governance perspective for implicit
   corruption based on the executive compensation incentive mechanism.

   courses of Chinese universities as the background, and focuses on the
   interactive ritual chain in the online courses. Research has found that
   a good online course helps to form a stable teacher-student interaction,
   so that both parties can gain attention and respect. Simultaneously, the
   suppression of power, the restriction of formalization, and the
   imbalance of symbolic capital will affect the participation of teachers
   and students in interactive rituals to a certain extent. Creating a good
   teacher-student interaction situation and integrating informational and

   crafting is positively related to psychological ownership. In addition,
   psychological ownership positively predicts work engagement and is

   show that, in a large number of delivery tests, 97% of deliveries
   contained a delivery error within 4 m, 64% of deliveries contained a
   delivery error within 2 m. The average delivery error was 1.86 m. The
   results of the experiment show that the accuracy of the UAV material
   delivery system is high, and the test results can provide reference for

AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate the regional sustainable
   development performance of 30 provinces in China from 2012 to 2017,
   based on a dynamic network slacks-based measure (DNSBM) approach. We
   construct an evaluation framework with a dynamic two-stage model with
   serial connection. The major difference between this paper and previous
   literatures is the assumption of installed capacity, defined as a
   carry-over linking between two consecutive terms. The empirical result
   of the average regional sustainable development performance is 0.3487
   for 2012-2017, due to lower average performance in the electricity
   portfolio stage than that in the energy productivity stage. The results
   from the model suggests that the provincial and central government
   should be put more efforts in the electricity portfolio, such as raising
   the zero-carbon capacity, to mitigate CO2 emission.

AB In this study, two chlorophyll A/B binding protein (CAB) genes (CsCP1
   and CsCP2) in tea plant were cloned. The proteins encoded by these genes
   belong to the external or internal antenna proteins of PS II,
   respectively. They may be the targets of physiological regulation for
   tea leaf cell PS II because they all contain multiple functional domains
   and modifiable sites. The CAB gene family in the tea genome consists of
   25 homologous genes. We measured the expression patterns of ten genes in
   the CsCP1 and CsCP2 subfamily under six different stresses. CsCP1
   expression was inhibited in response to 6 kinds of stress; CsCP2
   expression was slightly upregulated only after cold stress and ABA
   treatment. However, the expression levels of CSA016997 and CSA030476
   were upregulated significantly in the six stresses. The results
   suggested that the 10 CAB genes may have different functions in tea
   leaves. Moreover, changes in the expression of the 10 genes under stress
   appear to be related to ABA- and MeJA-dependent signalling pathways, and
   their responses to MeJA treatment is faster than those to ABA. In
   addition, we introduced our experiences for cloning the genes in the
   context of complex genomes.

   Then data is embedded in a layer-wise manner. For data embedding, the
   prediction-error and the local complexity are estimated using the idea
   of block-based image filtering, the related techniques of which have
   been widely studied in the area of image processing. Experimental
   results validate the applicability of the proposed work in the

   proposed, which uses the hierarchical construction of the bounding tree
   to delete the nodes that are not added, and improves the accuracy of
   collision detection in the scene. Finally, through the performance and
   function test of the collision module in the system, the result shows
   that the system has achieved the expected effect, has certain
   practicability, and has certain reference and reference significance for
   the collision detection problem.

AB China's increasingly frequent multilateral economic trade activities
   require continuous cultivate high-quality foreign language talents. With
   the outbreak of the COVID-19, foreign language teaching in universities
   is confronted with the rapid transition of teaching mode, and teacher's
   using status of online teaching platforms is urgently demanded to be
   understood. The purpose of this research is to explore the variable
   factors that influence teachers' intention to use online teaching
   platforms. This research uses the Technology Acceptance Model which has
   a relatively complete explanatory ability as the theoretical basis,
   extracts two core independent variables and introduces experience as
   interference factors to construct the framework of this research. Taking
   Guangxi universities as an example, a questionnaire survey was
   distributed to 35 universities, with 263 foreign language teachers
   participated anonymously. The results of data analysis can help
   education researchers comprehend the current foreign language teachers'
   using status of online teaching platforms, at the same time provide a
   knowledge-based understanding of how to optimize and cultivate teachers
   informationization teaching capabilities to governments and
   universities.

AB In October 2017 at the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist
   Party, Xi Jinping declared the arrival of 'the new era of socialism with
   Chinese characteristics', which is believed to herald a period distinct
   from Deng Xiaoping's era of Reform and Opening-up since the late 1970s.
   Concepts of 'cultural confidence' and 'the China dream', 'the great
   rejuvenation' marking the new historic period have actually been
   conceived as early as the mid-1990s and fully unfolded since the early
   2000s. Therefore, the turn of the century marks the transition between
   the reform era and the 'new era'. During this juncture, the emergence of
   heritage making became a signature phenomenon. It plays a prominent role
   in reshaping the cultural identity of common Chinese people, their
   perception of everyday tradition and the cultural orientation of
   economic life. This essay examines the heritage making of the town of
   Dongkeng, an ordinary industrial town located in the Pearl River Delta
   area, a symbolic region of the Reform and Opening-up. As the
   labour-intensive economic model went into crisis in the early 2000s,
   culture - especially folk and traditional culture - was adopted by local
   governments to earn new scoring points of economic growth and urban
   regeneration. Based on policy analysis and fieldwork interviews, I
   examine how the town tactically made use of intangible heritage to
   re-organize local cultural resources. Heritage making became the
   response to the town's desire of economic restructuring in the process.
   It also refashions the cultural narratives of economic restructuring.
   The essay concludes that the heritage process is one of re-organizing
   and interweaving everyday traditions and practices into local economic
   schemes, and this consolidated orientation of cultural identity
   characterizes China's transition towards a 'new era' of socio-economic
   development.

   informatization as Beijing. This research takes Guangzhou's higher
   vocational tourism teachers as the main body of research. The interview
   method was used to obtain relevant information and data. Through data
   analysis and comparison, two main problems were found: From the
   perspective of teachers, teachers' attention to information literacy is
   mainly in the use of information technology, but not enough attention to
   basic knowledge, information ethics, etc.; the level of information
   technology skills of teachers is not high. From a school perspective,
   the school lacks enough attention to teacher information literacy, lack
   of regular training of information technology skills, and lack of
   relevant information technology hardware. In this regard, this research
   proposes corresponding countermeasures: popularize the application of
   teaching information technology; improve teacher information literacy,
   develop teacher teaching information technology ability training;
   formulate higher vocational teacher information literacy evaluation
   standards, and include teacher information literacy into the teacher
   assessment system.

AB With the rapid development of urbanization, urban domestic waste is also
   increasing, if the garbage cannot be effectively classified, there will
   be a dilemma of garbage siege. In recent years, artificial intelligence
   technology has been applied in the field of garbage classification,
   which provides a convenient means for garbage classification. However,
   technological innovation can only alleviate the accumulated total amount
   of garbage, and finding the source of garbage generation is the key to
   solve the problem. Therefore, based on the theory of planned behavior,
   A-B-C theory and interpersonal behavior theory, from the policy level,
   the social level and the individual level, this paper puts forward some
   suggestions, it is composed of government, society, individual and other
   organizations, and puts forward the corresponding research hypotheses.
   Through interviewing and questionnaire survey in Guangzhou, the sample
   data are collected, and then regression analysis and structural equation
   model analysis are used to obtain the influence degree value of
   residents' attitude towards garbage classification, subjective norms,
   perceived behavior control, situational factors, and government legal
   regulation on residents' living garbage classification willingness. The
   results show that residents' attitude towards domestic waste
   classification is significant and the government's legal control factors
   are the key factors affecting the residents' willingness of garbage
   classification.

AB Purpose This study aimed to advance the understanding of employees'
   individual-level absorptive capacity by examining the mechanisms of
   three dimensions of their work outcomes: contextual performance,
   citizenship behaviors toward customers and service sabotage. Drawing on
   the theory of psychological ownership, the author theorized and assessed
   how employees' individual-level absorptive capacity predicts different
   facets of employees' work outcomes through psychological ownership.
   Design/methodology/approach Multisource data were collected from 334
   subordinates from the hospitality industry in Taiwan over two time
   periods. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling,
   the results of which indicated that employees' individual-level
   absorptive capacity was positively related to psychological ownership.
   Findings Psychological ownership positively predicted contextual
   performance and citizenship behaviors toward customers; however, it was
   negatively associated with service sabotage. Finally, it was found to
   mediate the effects of employees' individual-level absorptive capacity
   on contextual performance, citizenship behaviors toward customers and
   service sabotage. Originality/value This study contributed to
   understanding the relationship between individual-level absorptive
   capacity and shaping perceptions of service workers and provided several
   theoretical implications for absorptive capacity and tourism literature.

AB With the development of Internet finance, customer behavior and
   consumption habits have transformed and brought new challenges to
   commercial banks' traditional branches in China. Bank branches face the
   pressure of rising operating costs, declining profits, and being
   gradually replaced by online services. Under the smart economic trend,
   bank branches are facing significant transforming and upgrading.
   Branches will gradually transform their roles from traditional business
   transaction centers to product marketing and customer experience
   centers. The intelligent upgrading and transformation of branches play
   an essential role in accelerating the process. In this paper, our
   research focuses on user experience in the smart branch and adjust with
   the smart society development trend. We study smart diversions'
   pre-processing at smart branches, establish smart queuing models, and
   mobile appointment systems to control the queue. We compare the smart
   model with the traditional under the bank's virtual simulation system.
   Use customer waiting time for service and employee work intensity as
   essential indicators of the queuing model. The simulation results show
   that the branch uses intelligent distribution is much more efficient
   than the traditional one. Customer experience and service efficiency are
   greatly improved.

AB As an increasing amount of personal data has been gathered by wearable
   and mobile devices, self-tracking, or the practice that people keep
   track, has become an important topic in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
   big data applications. With the aim to provide a systematic review of
   the literature on self-tracking, this paper presents a scientometric
   analysis of 109 articles since 2000 collected from the Web of Science.
   Based on keyword co-occurrence network analysis, the paper has
   identified four major clusters: (1) wearables as quantified-self
   applications; (2) big data and critical theory; (3) data and privacy;
   (4) personal informatics. The further keywords-in-context (KWIC)
   analysis of the abstracts of the dataset clarifies the
   seemingly-interchangeable notions of ldquoself-trackingrdquo and
   ldquoquantified-selfrdquo: While ldquoself-trackingrdquo refers to more
   general activities, practices, technologies, and applications of keeping
   tracks, ldquoquantified-selfrdquo refers to the more conscious efforts
   and meaning-making outcomes of the self-tracking activities. Such
   clarification, along with the keyword network analysis, suggests that
   self-tracking has become a specific and major type of datafication of
   human conditions or existence and that quantified-self is the
   construction of self through such datafication. A more integrated
   conceptual framework is needed for future research to better understand
   what amounts to meaningful datafication of human conditions and
   existence, thereby helping researchers and designers to discern the
   classic notions of health, wellness, and happiness for better research
   and design outcomes.

AB At present, the information technology service industry is showing a
   good development trend. The rapid development of information technology
   has a significant impact on various fields. Driven by information
   technology, vocational training and education also enjoy the dividend
   brought by the development of information technology. In this context,
   vocational training provides more workers with endless opportunities,
   promotes the development of the labor market, and brings help to the
   wage problem of young people, especially some children. At the same
   time, vocational training is closely related to employment and
   education, which has brought certain changes to the youth and the labor
   market. Moreover, the state's attention to vocational training is also
   increasing, and vocational training is of great significance to the
   transformation of employment and education. However, there is a gap in
   the bibliometric analysis of this topic. Based on 694 articles retrieved
   from the web of science database from 1950 to 2020, this paper mainly

AB With the advent of the new technology times, big data technology has
   been widely used as an important strategy of comprehensive social
   governance. The development of big data not only represents huge amount
   of data, advanced information technology and huge business
   opportunities, but also is an effective method to solve problems,
   transform the world and explore new ideas and scientific applications in
   the future. However, big data in economic development does not mean that
   it can replace all the rational thinking of social problems. The logic
   of scientific development cannot be annihilated in the mass data. In
   this era of rapid development of intelligent hardware, an important
   problem for application developers is how to find the delicate balance
   between power, coverage, transmission rate and cost. Enterprise
   organizations can use relevant data and analysis to help them reduce
   costs, improve efficiency, develop new products and make more informed
   business decisions.

AB Production-oriented approach (POA) adopts a three-step of teaching
   process of ldquomotivating-enabling-evaluatingrdquo, and integrates
   teaching concepts of ldquoLearning centeredrdquo, ldquoLearning -using
   integratedrdquo and ldquoWhole-person educationrdquo throughout the
   teaching process. And with the rapid development of AI and network
   technology, the Blended Learning (BL) came into being as online
   self-learning has become an inevitable learning trend. BL is an
   ldquoonline + offlinerdquo learning that combines the advantages of
   online and traditional learning. This research explores the
   applicability of POA and BL in College Intensive Reading Course.
   Students' feedback and the teacher's reflection after one unit of
   teaching experiment show that: compared with traditional teaching
   methods of Intensive Reading lessons, this teaching mode combined with
   POA and BL is more effective, flexible and interesting, arousing
   students' enthusiasm for learning, cultivating students' abilities of
   language output, autonomous learning, group cooperation and critical
   thinking and etc. The new model of POA can effectively transform the
   input material from the received knowledge to the output knowledge by
   offering students the scenarios and task requirements and assessments to
   stimulate students' enthusiasm and creativity to complete the output
   task and assessment to a great extent. It improves the efficiency of
   English learning and promotes the comprehensive skills of college
   English majors. Meanwhile, BL can expand classroom resources and
   learning time and space, and the application of multi-modal media on the
   online learning platform also brings more fun and efficiency to learning
   and assessment. The combination of the two makes the teaching effect
   significant. Some difficulties and challenges are also discovered in
   implementation of POA and BL. Therefore, the joint efforts of the school
   and teachers are needed in the future teaching research and practice.

AB The United States, the European Union and most RCEP members are
   important vegetable importers of China. However, in recent years,
   against the background of anti-globalization, many countries have set up
   green trade barriers of different degrees for vegetable import. Trade
   gravity model is a theoretical hypothesis established by Newton's
   gravitation formula, which is used by economists to explain the problem
   of determining the flow of trade within a sector. This paper uses the
   time series data from 2000 to 2019, modifies the gravity model, and uses
   STATA 12.0 for regression to analyze the impact of the green trade
   barrier degree of China's main vegetable trade companies on China, and
   analyzes the changing trend of this influence. Based on the analysis
   results, we can see the influence of green trade barriers on China's
   vegetable products is expected to be further reduced, especially after
   the signing of the RCEP, so China's export will increase, but China's
   vegetable export direction is going to focus on the east area in the
   short term. We suggest that China comply with international standards,
   improve the supply chain and logistics system of agricultural products,
   enhance the international competitiveness of vegetable products and
   diversify trade directions.

AB Background: By implementing aggressive control measures, China has
   rapidly and effectively controlled the Coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the neglected homeless population may
   become victims of that perceived success. Due to political sensitivity,
   we know little about them. Aims: This study aimed to investigate how the
   pandemic and the pandemic control strategies of the government affected
   the lives of the homeless people in mainland China. Methods: A total of
   103 eligible participants experiencing absolute homelessness were
   recruited from Guangzhou City during July and August 2020. Surveys
   measured demographic characteristics including health status, changes in
   daily living, and actions of the government toward the homeless during
   the pandemic. Sankey diagrams and ordered logit regression models were
   used to examine the impact on the homeless of inhumane government
   efforts to drive the homeless away. Qualitative materials were analyzed
   by using an inductive approach to provide more details. Results: First,
   the homeless people in Guangzhou tended to be male, aged 40 to 64 years,
   less well-educated, and they originated from outside Guangdong although
   they were living in the city center. Most had little connection with
   their families. After a long period of homelessness, almost half of the
   participants were in poor health with various conditions, which made
   them extremely vulnerable to COVID-19. Second, the pandemic caused a
   substantial decline in incomes of homeless people, had less of a
   negative impact on their food intake, and affected sleep time in
   different ways. Third, during the COVID-19 pandemic, humanitarian aid
   from local governments of China decreased, whereas inhumane efforts to
   drive the homeless away intensified. Fourth, quantitative models and
   qualitative materials demonstrate the devastating effect of the strict
   pandemic control strategy of the government on the lives of homeless
   people, which may further cause their health problems. Conclusion: This
   study for the first time illustrated the characteristic features of the
   street homeless population in mainland China and their living situation
   during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most importantly demonstrated the
   devastating effect of the strict pandemic control of the government,
   which has been considered a great success in previous studies, on lives
   of homeless people. Urgent measures should be taken to ensure the
   protection of the homeless population and prevent an impending
   humanitarian crisis.

   pandemic. Therefore, using design thinking and system thinking to guide
   both digital transformation and green transformation gains more
   significance under such circumstances. Still, there is no systematic
   review of how user experience advances green and digital transformation.
   The purpose of the article is to provide a cross-disciplinary groundwork
   of user experience design related to green and digital transformation.
   User experience certainly occurs at every stage of a digital project so
   that both the user and service producer can refer to the result of this

   the annual trends since 1995, main research disciplines, and publication
   outlets based on a scientometric analysis of 250 articles collected from
   the Web of Science database. Future research can build upon the
   preliminary findings here for the methodological, information, and

AB Background Ramie degumming is often carried out at high temperatures;
   therefore, thermostable alkaline pectate lyase (PL) is beneficial for
   ramie degumming for industrial applications. Thermostable PLs are
   usually obtained by exploring new enzymes or reconstructing existing
   enzyme by rational design. Here, we improved the thermostability of an
   alkaline pectate lyase (PelN) from Paenibacillus sp. 0602 with rational
   design and structure-based engineering. Results From 26 mutants, two
   mutants of G241A and G241V showed a higher thermostability compared with
   the wild-type PL. The mutant K93I showed increasing specific activity at
   45 degrees C. Subsequently, we obtained combinational mutations
   (K93I/G241A) and found that their thermostability and specific activity
   improved simultaneously. The K93I/G241A mutant showed a half-life time
   of 15.9 min longer at 60 degrees C and a melting temperature of 1.6
   degrees C higher than those of the wild PL. The optimum temperature
   decreased remarkably from 67.5 degrees C to 60 degrees C, accompanied by
   a 57% decrease in Km compared with the Km value of the wild-type strain.
   Finally, we found that the intramolecular interaction in PelN was the
   source in the improvements of molecular properties by comparing the
   model structures. Rational design of PelN was performed by stabilizing
   the alpha-helices with high conservation and increasing the stability of
   the overall structure of the protein. Two engineering strategies were
   applied by decreasing the mutation energy calculated by Discovery Studio
   and predicting the free energy in the process of protein folding by the
   PoPMuSiC algorithm. Conclusions The results demonstrated that the
   K93I/G241A mutant was more suitable for industrial production than the
   wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, the two forementioned strategies could be
   extended to reveal engineering of other kinds of industrial enzymes.

AB Purpose
   Fear appeals in advertising communication are considered by advertisers
   when other types of advertising appeals do not achieve expected effects.
   Fear appeals, by arousing the fear that something may threaten
   consumers' present lives, are often adopted to persuade individuals to
   take a particular action. Although this topic has been widely studied,
   the internal operation mechanism of fear appeals in consumers has not
   been fully understood or agreed upon.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Three experiments were conducted where the type of fear appeal was
   manipulated (i.e. physical fear appeal or social ear appeal), as well as
   consumers' consideration of future consequences (CFC) and mental imagery
   approaches.
   Findings
   This study examined the effects of fear appeal on mental imagery fluency
   and how it affects advertising effectiveness and the moderating effect
   of consumers' CFC were discussed. When receiving advertisements with
   physical fear appeals, consumers with low CFC had greater mental imagery
   fluency than did those with high CFC. Furthermore, consumers' purchase
   intentions could be improved by increasing consumers' mental imagery
   fluency on fear appeal. Therefore, the interaction between fear appeal
   and CFC on purchase intention was mediated by mental imagery fluency.
   This study found that consumers responded differently to fear appeal
   advertising when they engaged in different mental imagery approaches.
   Originality/value
   The present study adds to social marketing literature by showing how
   consumers' mental imagery fluency influence the fear appeal
   effectiveness, and this study's results also enable social marketers to
   understand the two factors (i.e. consumers' CFC level and mental imagery
   approaches) that affect the influence of fear appeals on consumers'
   purchase intentions. Moreover, social marketers are recommended to
   provide consumers with advertising information by using various message
   types to facilitate consumers' imagination of advertising appeals. This
   heightens the importance of consumers' acceptance and absorption of
   advertising content, in turn, strengthening their purchase intentions.

AB Chitosanases can catalyze the release of chitooligosaccharides which
   have a number of medical applications. Therefore, Chitosanases are good
   candidates for large-scale enzymatic synthesis due to their favorable
   thermostability properties and high catalytic efficiency. To further
   improve the thermostability of a chitosanase from Bacillus sp. TS, which
   has a half-life of 5.32 min, we mutated specific serine residues that we
   identified as potentially relevant through structure comparison with
   thermophilic CelA from Clostridium thermocellum. Out of a total of 15
   mutants, three, namely S265G, S276A, and S347G, show higher
   thermostability. Their half-lives at 60 degrees C were calculated as
   34.57 min, 36.79 min and 7.2 min. The K-m values of S265G, S276A and
   S347G mutants show substrate binding ability comparable to that of the
   wild-type enzyme, while the S265G mutant displays a significant decrease
   of enzymatic activities. Additionally, we studied the synergistic
   effects of combined mutations, observing that all double mutants and the
   triple mutant are more stable than the wild-type enzyme and single
   mutants. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms which might give a
   reasonable explanation for the improved thermostability via comparative
   analysis of the resulting 3D structures.

AB In a highly intertwined and connected business environment, globalized
   layout planning can be an effective way for enterprises to expand their
   market. Nevertheless, conflicts and contradictions always exist between
   parent and subsidiary enterprises; if they are in different countries,
   these conflicts can become especially problematic. Internal control
   systems for subsidiary supervision and management seem to be
   particularly important when aiming to align subsidiaries' decisions with
   parent enterprises' strategic intentions, and such systems undoubtedly
   involve numerous criteria/dimensions. An effective tool is urgently
   needed to clarify the relevant issues and discern the cause-and-effect
   relationships among them in these conflicts. Traditional statistical
   approaches cannot fully explain these situations due to the complexity
   and invisibility of the criteria/dimensions; thus, the fuzzy rough set
   theory (FRST), with its superior data exploration ability and
   impreciseness tolerance, can be considered to adequately address the
   complexities. Motivated by efficient integrated systems, aggregating
   multiple dissimilar systems' outputs and converting them into a
   consensus result can be useful for realizing outstanding performances.
   Based on this concept, we insert selected criteria/dimensions via FRST
   into DEMATEL to identify and analyze the dependency and feedback
   relations among variables of parent/subsidiary gaps and conflicts. The
   results present the improvement priorities based on their magnitude of
   impact, in the following order: organizational control structure,
   business and financial information system management, major financial
   management, business strategy management, construction of a management
   system, and integrated audit management. Managers can consider the
   potential implications herein when formulating future targeted policies
   to improve subsidiary supervision and strengthen overall corporate
   governance.

AB In recent years, companies have been facing great pressure and threat
   from competition, so they have been looking for suitable partners to
   establish strategic partnerships. On the one hand, strategic
   partnerships work as a response strategy; on the other hand, they help
   to enhance each partner's competitive advantage. Although previous
   literature and related studies have paid attention to the development of
   partnerships, scholars have rarely made an integrated study of the
   development of partnerships. Therefore, this study intends to establish
   an integrated model for the development of partnerships, which is
   divided into three stages, namely, selecting the best partner,
   establishing a partnership, and maintaining a good partnership, and to
   discuss the development of the key influencing variables for each stage.
   The results of this study are as follows: (1) three types of ocean
   companies (marine fishery products companies, mariculture companies, and
   shipping companies) believe that the buyer and the seller should
   carefully select the cooperation object in the first stage, which will
   naturally contribute to the development of the relationship, and (2) the
   three types of ocean companies have a positive impact on the development
   of partnerships on importance of the variables is obviously related to
   the characteristics of the firm.

AB The regional logistics industry is of great significance to promote the
   development of industrial structure. This paper measures the regional
   agglomeration, enterprise agglomeration and regional agglomeration
   structure of the logistics industry in the Pearl River Delta from 2013
   to 2019, and uses the gray correlation model to analyze the relationship
   between transportation, storage and postal industry, wholesale and
   retail industry and economic development. The study found that the
   logistics industry in the Pearl River Delta at this stage has not formed
   a reasonable agglomeration structure, whether it is transportation,
   storage and postal industry, or wholesale and retail. The agglomeration
   and structure of the transportation, storage, and postal industries in
   the Pearl River Delta are better than those of wholesale and retail, but
   the agglomeration of wholesale and retail has a greater impact on
   economic development. Full attention should be paid to the promotion of
   regional economic development by the agglomeration of the logistics
   industry, the positive externalities of the agglomeration of the
   logistics industry should be brought into play, the supply-side reform
   of the logistics industry should be actively promoted, and
   differentiated guidance strategies should be adopted for the
   transportation, warehousing and postal industries, and wholesale and
   retail industries.

AB Econometrics is a core course for undergraduates majoring in economics.
   Abstraction and tediousness make it difficult for teachers to teach and
   students to learn. Reform of the teaching mode based on lectures is
   imperative. Based on the content of chapter "Multivariate Regression
   Analysis", this paper introduces the practical application of case
   teaching method in the course design and teaching content of economics
   undergraduate teaching. The students were randomly divided into
   traditional teaching group and case teaching group. After the course,
   the two teaching methods were evaluated and compared. The results showed
   that the case teaching method was more effective. Finally, this article
   puts forward some problems that should be noticed when applying this
   teaching method in the teaching of econometrics.

AB With the globalizing of economic development in recent years,
   cross-border e-commerce has gradually broken the traditional import and
   export model and shown great development potential. However, since the
   differences in policy, culture, regular, and social systems among
   different countries and areas exist, the stake of credit has become a
   challenge for the development of cross-border e-commerce. The big data
   produced by these institutions are becoming the focus of related
   research. By utilizing the data rationally, enterprises can skillfully
   avoid the risk and reach a better development. In this paper, a credit
   assessment indicator system to solve the credit challenges of
   cross-border e-commerce of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in
   Guangdong was proposed. Furthermore, a rational credit stake assessment
   model was established by using the computational method of hierarchical
   analysis to determine the weight of various indicators. The validation
   of the proposed model was assessed by an evaluation method based on the
   fuzzy system in the computer field. The model provides a firm ground for
   cross-border e-commerce enterprises to make policies to reduce or even
   avoid loss when facing credit risk. This cross-field research combing
   the computational models with the business behaviors contributes to the
   healthy and sustainable developments for cross-border e-commerce SMEs in
   Guangdong.

AB Sustainable development has always been an important issue for all
   policy makers, even more so now, as global warming has seriously
   threatened the whole world. To understand the efficacy of regional
   sustainable policies, we proposed a dynamic, two-stage, slacks-based
   measure (SBM) model with carry-over and intermediate variables,
   highlighting the importance of an electricity portfolio, to measure
   overall energy performance for the purpose of regional sustainable
   development. In this unified linear programming framework with
   intertemporal evaluation, we estimated the effects of a clean
   electricity supply by the abatement of CO2 emissions and the gain of
   economic growth. The results can be used as a reference for decision
   makers to shape regional sustainable development policies. Using data of
   30 provincial administration regions in China for the period of
   2012-2017, we postulate that the lower energy performance of the Chinese
   regional economic system for sustainable development may be attributed
   to a lower electricity portfolio performance. We then postulate that
   investment in low-carbon energy infrastructure can combat CO2 emissions,
   and is also a major driving force in the regional economic growth.

   events, in this work, we propose an information filtering mechanism of
   internet forum based on bilayer long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural
   network. First, we propose a text information classification model based
   on LSTM neural network and related mechanism. Then, we evaluate the
   proposed mechanism by using the practical internet forums. The
   experimental results and analysis reveal that the proposed algorithm
   significantly improves the textual information quality as well as the

   indicating the critical role of medical staff resources in controlling
   epidemics. Nevertheless, it is difficult to ensure that there exist
   enough medical personnel in cities severely hit by the outbreak. China
   provides solutions by adopting nationwide "pairing assistance" measures
   with at least one province assisting one city to alleviate pressure in
   the most severe area. By plotting the number of patients receiving

AB Optical buffering is one of the essential functions in optical packet

   multiple-access (OCDMA) signals of spectral-amplitude-coding (SAC) in a
   packet-buffering architecture. In the proposed scheme, the original
   OCDMA label of the incoming packet is identified and converted to a new
   label by a code-switching system. As multiple packets overlap in the
   time domain in a single device, SAC is adopted for packet encoding to
   avoid multiple access interference (MAI). The concepts of queuing system
   and Gaussian approximation are employed to model the buffer
   architecture. Simulations were conducted to demonstrate the tradeoff
   between packet dropping probability and the signal variations in the
   label identification process. The buffering performance in terms of
   bit-error rate (BER) is examined. The results show SAC labels perform
   well on packet buffering.

AB Few studies have examined the issue of the sustainable destination
   development of hot spring from tourists' perspective. This study thus
   proposes a model for sustainable tourism development of hot spring
   destinations following poverty alleviation in local communities. This
   model is based on environmental (environmental cognition), sociocultural
   (hot spring experience, food experience, and attitude toward cultural
   landscape), and economic (revisit intention) dimensions (factors) of
   sustainability. The analysis of 271 valid on-site questionnaires about
   the Conghua hot spring destination in Guangzhou, China, showed that the
   attitude toward cultural landscape, hot spring experiences, and
   environmental cognition are the important factors that influence the
   intention of tourists to revisit hot spring. These findings are based on
   the level of importance; however, food experience did not play a
   significant role. Through the cultural landscape, the connection between
   tourists and destinations is strengthened, which helps to increase the
   likelihood of tourists revisiting the destination. This study found that
   the purpose of cultural legacy can be achieved while balancing
   environmental development issues, and is one of the guidelines for
   sustainable development in poverty alleviation in destination.

AB In this paper, an optical buffering solution based on label switching is
   proposed, where packets are buffered by identifying and renewing the
   light labels of pseudo-orthogonal codes. The buffer overflow occurs when
   label switching fails to perform on the queued packets due to the
   insufficient labels. Assigning an increased code number to the buffer
   could reduce the overflow effect, but the decoder noise mitigates its
   efficiency. Therefore, we study a noise-immune labeling method of
   residual function by advancing the correlation properties of the
   existing codes. The proposed label-switching scheme improves the
   solution efficiency to buffer overflow as a lower code-error probability
   can be reached. Moreover, multiple label codes can be simultaneously
   generated from a shared light source to achieve a power-efficient buffer
   structure.

AB Generalized multi-protocol label-switching (GMPLS) provides
   packet-switching with multiple speeds and quality-of-services (QoSs).
   Packet buffering in GMPLS reduces packet loss by resolving the conflicts
   between packets requesting for a common channel. Presently, due to the
   diversity of multimedia applications, enabling multiple services in
   networks has become necessary. In this paper, a family of codes known as
   composite maximal-length sequence (CMLS) codes is introduced into an
   optical buffering scheme based on code-switching. A given number of
   available CMLS codes is divided into several code subsets. The buffer
   selects an unused CMLS code from a code subset and assigns it to the
   incoming packet. When all codes in a specific subset have been
   distributed to the queued packets, a free CMLS code in another subset is
   chosen for the new arrival. To achieve multi-level buffering services,
   the partition scenario with a lower subset number but with a higher
   number of codes in an individual subset is used as a code-assigning
   method for buffering high-QoS users. A two-level buffering system is
   demonstrated by examining the QoS of each class in terms of
   packet-dropping probability (PDP). The results show that different
   levels of PDPs can be effectively supported by a common buffer
   architecture.

AB When digital technologies have disrupted creative and cultural
   industries, it becomes vital for organizations of arts, culture, and
   creativity to reexamine their business or operation models to change
   their practices. When climate change has been shaping the cultural
   attitudes and values, it becomes also relevant for the very
   organizations to adopt practices that advance both human and sustainable
   development. Thus, creative and cultural sectors need strategies to
   navigate the increasing need of green and digital transformation. To
   date, little research has been conducted on this topic, and thus this
   exploratory bibliometric analysis aims to fill the gap by a systematic
   review of the relevant literature. Based on 991 articles, this paper
   outlines the main areas of discussions and issues as well as the
   opportunities and challenges for research and policy innovations. The
   findings have revealed the significance of tourism, sustainability and
   Internet in the state-of-art literature, thereby highlighting the need
   for an integrated approach to green and digital transformation for
   creative and cultural industries. Future research can be conducted
   across different creative and cultural sectors, so as to allow
   researchers to generalize and construct the notion of smart and
   sustainable cultural consumption and production (SCP) as the timely and
   relevant contribution to the wider sustainable SCP literature.

   interpretations are to some extent bound to differ depending on whether
   the audience does or does not have detailed knowledge of Chinese
   culture. We end by briefly arguing that a full analysis of the clips -
   as indeed of most discourses - requires awareness of yet other tropes as
   well as expertise in other humanities disciplines.

AB In 2018, the number of internet users in Taiwan reached 18.66 million.
   The online rate was 79.2%, which was 0.4% higher than that in 2017.
   Moreover, the annual growth rate of Taiwan's online shopping market is
   double digits, suggesting the rapid expansion of online shops and the
   popular trend in online shopping. Managing a store on the internet
   platform offers many advantages, such as low operating cost, cheaper
   fees, greater sources of customers, and keyword marketing. As online
   shopping becomes prevalent in Taiwan, online shops are considered
   effective sales channels. Among the online shops, there are many small
   organic shops operated by farmers, as well as chain organic stores.
   However, researches on Taiwan's online purchase and sales of organic
   agricultural products (vegetables and fruits) are very sparse. The
   subjects were mostly urban women, who are white-collar workers, have
   middle to upper income levels, a high level of education, and are highly
   frequent internet shoppers. The findings indicate that in the booming
   online shopping market, urban women's attitude and perceived behavioral
   control positively, affect their intention to buy organic agricultural
   products (vegetables and fruits) online. Chain stores and farmers should
   consider internet marketing as an important sales channel targeting
   urban women.

   model to a combination of place and space into an e-business model.
   Companies can build strong customer relationships and increase
   cross-sales chances with a successful digital transformation. In this
   study, Hybridized Integrated Statistical Model (HISM) has been proposed
   for identifying the impacts of e-business and organizational management
   in the online market. Execution of e-business helped the organizations
   move towards standardization by revealing variety and lack of process
   standardization between different business units. Data analysis
   demonstrates positive and expressive relationships between the internet
   and customers with e-business and similar e-business experiences for
   internal organizational processes with the organization's performance.
   The numerical results show that the proposed HISM method achieves a high
   productivity ratio of 96.7%, an organizational performance ratio of
   97.2%, a customer satisfaction ratio of 95.6%, an online sales ratio of
   94.3%, decision-making level of 93.8% when compared to other existing

   large-scale investigation of collective action propagation with
   "recurrence" phenomena. We consider actions that propagate in a social
   network with multiple communities and find the growth in the propagation
   breadth of collective action can be explained by a simple mathematical
   model with an analytical solution. We use datasets on the growth of
   total views of TED and YouTube videos, the prize pool of Dota 2
   tournaments, and a total gross of movies to investigate collective
   action propagation with recurrence phenomena. Experimental results
   reveal that our model can capture universal features of collective
   action propagation, validating the idea that collective action
   propagation with recurrence results from an action being transmitted
   from communities to communities.

   For practicality, we sieve through previous researches to identify 20
   factors (grouped into 4 Dimensions: Personal Dimension Teacher's

   Environment Dimension), which most likely correlated with the quality of
   the stay of mobile Chinese-speaking students in France. We adopt the

   However, with a large scale of features, the performances of fundamental
   neural networks are not stable or accurate enough. As a result, an
   ensemble GRU (Gate Recurrent Unit) neural network is proposed for
   short-term PM2.5 prediction. This approach can improve accuracy while
   maintaining stability by combining the outputs after varying training.
   In this study, a dataset, which recording 6 indicators (PM2.5, PM10, CO,
   NO2, O3, SO2) for more than 20,000 hours in Shenzhen, is adopted to
   evaluate the proposed approach. Experimental results indicate that the
   proposed ensemble GRU model provides the lowest scores in MSE, RMSE
   criteria, and the best average-results in R2, MSE, RMSE scores.

AB In today's rapid economic development, the competitiveness of
   enterprises is more and more reflected in the talent competition, and
   the important means to obtain talents is recruitment. With the
   development of economy, recruitment channels are becoming more and more
   diversified. Enterprises will choose recruitment channels according to
   various reasons to recruit suitable candidates for the vacant positions
   of the enterprise. However, after finding the suitable people, how to
   keep them or hire them. After the recruitment of employees, whether the
   performance of employees is related to the recruitment channels has an
   important reference role for the selection of human resources. We use AI
   technology to measure the performance of employees through the three
   dimensions of subjective initiative, job satisfaction and job self
   dedication. Therefore, it has theoretical and practical value for
   improving the recruitment effect and contribution.

   Big Data, AI, and Machine Learning with Accounting, Auditing, and
   Accountability, based on 259 articles retrieved from Web of Science
   Database since 1989 to 2019. With the database, the author analyzed
   occurrences and produced the data contact network with the United States
   as the largest data resource subject and associated in three directions.
   Through the comparison of the three figures, it is not difficult to find
   that the countries with advantages in data resources have more influence
   in an organizational and sources cluster, and the United States is the
   most obvious example.

AB Due to the increasing consumption of food products and demand for food
   quality and safety, most food processing facilities in the United States
   utilize machines to automate their processes, such as cleaning,
   inspection and grading, packing, storing, and shipping. Machine vision
   technology has been a proven solution for inspection and grading of food
   products since the late 1980s. The remaining challenges, especially for
   small to midsize facilities, include the system and operating costs,
   demand for high-skilled workers for complicated configuration and
   operation and, in some cases, unsatisfactory results. This paper focuses
   on the development of an embedded solution with learning capability to
   alleviate these challenges. Three simple application cases are included
   to demonstrate the operation of this unique solution. Two datasets of
   more challenging cases were created to analyze and demonstrate the
   performance of our visual inspection algorithm. One dataset includes
   infrared images of Medjool dates of four levels of skin delamination for
   surface quality grading. The other one consists of grayscale images of
   oysters with varying shape for shape quality evaluation. Our algorithm
   achieved a grading accuracy of 95.0% on the date dataset and 98.6% on
   the oyster dataset, both easily surpassed manual grading, which
   constantly faces the challenges of human fatigue or other distractions.
   Details of the design and functions of our smart camera and our simple
   visual inspection algorithm are discussed in this paper.

   in the Chinese stock market. Our findings indicate that the reversal
   factor does a better job than the turnover factor in explaining return
   spreads and negative momentum profits from both the cross-section and
   time-series perspectives. In addition, the reversal factor is better
   than the turnover factor when discussing excess returns from the
   cross-section perspective. By contrast, regardless of whether the
   time-series turnover factor or the cross-section turnover factor is
   considered, they are both characterized by insignificant slopes in a
   factor model facing return spreads, which suggests that there are
   actually notable underlying shortcomings behind the turnover factor.
   Overall, our work implies that the reversal factor is a better fourth
   factor in the Chinese stock market.

AB Covariance matrices have attracted increasing attention for data
   representation in many computer vision tasks. The nonsingular covariance
   matrices are regarded as points on Riemannian manifolds rather than
   Euclidean space. A common technique for classification on Riemannian
   manifolds is to embed the covariance matrices into a reproducing kernel
   Hilbert space (RKHS), and then construct a map from RKHS to Euclidean
   space, while the explicit map from RKHS to Euclidean space in most
   kernel-based methods only depends on a linear hypothesis. In this paper,
   we propose a subspace learning framework to project Riemannian manifolds
   to Euclidean space, and give the theoretical derivation for it.
   Specifically, the Euclidean space is isomorphic to the subspace of RKHS.
   Under the framework, firstly we define an improved Log-Euclidean
   Gaussian radial basis function kernel for embedding. The first order
   statistical features of input images are incorporated into the kernel
   function to increase the discriminative power. After that we seek the
   optimal projection matrix of the subspace of the RKHS by conducting a
   graph embedding discriminant analysis. Texture recognition and object
   categorization experiments with region covariance descriptors
   demonstrate the considerable effectiveness of the improved Log-Euclidean
   Gaussian RBK kernel and the proposed method.

AB Modern service industry is one of the industries that widely applies
   artificial intelligent (AI) in the era of big data. The development of
   modern service industry plays a very important role in industrial
   transformation. The emergence of AI technology improves the
   effectiveness of data mining, and more and more scholars suggest a
   series of optimization methods to lift the prediction ability. In this
   study, tangent fruit fly optimization algorithm with step adjust
   (TANSAFOA) is proposed and it is used to optimize multivariate adaptive
   regression splines (MARS) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) to
   construct a prediction model of business performance. The result shows
   TANSAFOA can effectively optimize the prediction model and the BPNN
   model optimized by TANSAFOA has higher prediction performance than MARS.
   TANSAFOA BPNN-model is the most appropriate prediction model for modern
   service industry in China.

AB At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic has triggered
   global public health concern. Here, a model integrating the daily
   intercity migration network, which constructed from real-world migration
   records and the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, is utilized
   to predict the epidemic spreading of the COVID-19 in more than 300
   cities in China. However, the model has more than 1800 unknown
   parameters, which is a challenging task to estimate all unknown
   parameters from historical data within a reasonable computation time. In
   this article, we proposed a pseudocoevolutionary simulated annealing
   (SA) algorithm for identifying these unknown parameters. The large
   volume of unknown parameters of this model is optimized through three
   procedures co-adapted SA-based optimization processes, respectively. Our
   results confirm that the proposed method is both efficient and robust.
   Then, we use the identified model to predict the trends of the epidemic
   spreading of the COVID-19 in these cities. We find that the number of
   infections in most cities in China has reached their peak from February
   29, 2020, to March 15, 2020. For most cities outside Hubei province, the
   total number of infected individuals would be less than 100, while for
   most cities in Hubei province (exclude Wuhan), the total number of
   infected individuals would be less than 3000.

AB Feature detection, description, and matching are crucial steps for many

   match image features across sets of images. Previous work has shown that
   our SYnthetic BAsis (SYBA) feature descriptor can offer superior
   performance to other binary descriptors. This paper focused on various
   optimizations and hardware implementation of the newer and optimized
   version. The hardware implementation on a field-programmable gate array
   (FPGA) is a high-throughput low-latency solution which is critical for
   applications such as high-speed object detection and tracking, stereo
   vision, visual odometry, structure from motion, and optical flow. We
   compared our solution to other hardware designs of binary descriptors.
   We demonstrated that our implementation of SYBA as a feature descriptor
   in hardware offered superior image feature matching performance and used
   fewer resources than most binary feature descriptor implementations.

   underpinning of low participation in screening programs using the method
   of meta-analytic structural equation modeling. It was found that the

   the intended uptake of screening was positively predicted only by cues
   to action, health literacy, and perceived susceptibility. As a result, a
   health intention model, including the three significant variables, is
   proposed. The practical implications of the findings are that health

   accuracy, linearity, anti-interference ability, and cross-reactivity of
   the Daan HCV RNA quantitative assay. Overall 198 clinical serum
   specimens were used to make comparison between the Daan HCV RNA
   quantitative assay and the Roche Cobas test. Results The within-run
   precision (S-within), and total precision (S-total) for 6.11 log IU/mL,
   4.22 log IU/mL, and 2.32 log IU/mL HCV RNA were 0.13 and 0.15, 0.07 and
   0.09, and 0.11 and 0.10, respectively. The linear range was 20-10(8)
   IU/mL, and the limit of detection was 15 IU/mL. It did not display any
   interference with commonly encountered conditions and cross-reactivity
   with some common virus. A good agreement was observed between the Daan
   HCV RNA quantitative assay and the Roche Cobas test. Conclusion The Daan
   HCV RNA quantitative assay has shown satisfactory performances and
   excellent agreement with COBAS HCV Quantitative Test on clinical
   specimens with lower cost, which provides an alternative choice for the
   diagnosis and monitoring of HCV infection in developing countries.

AB Background: The aim of the study is to evaluate the significance of the
   Architect anti-HCV signal to cutoff (S/CO) ratios for predicting
   hepatitis C viremia and determine the optimal S/Co ratio value for
   Architect anti-HCV assay.
   Methods: The results of patients who underwent HCV RNA quantitative
   assays because of positive anti-HCV from January 2015 to August 2019
   were retrospectively analyzed, including S/Co ratio values, HCV RNA
   quantitative results, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate
   transaminase (AST) values. Binary logistic regression and Spearman's
   correlation coefficient were used to analyze the collected data.
   Receiver-operating characteristics curve (ROC) was applied to analyze
   the predicting values of the indexes.
   Results: In total, 811 patients were included in our study and HCV
   viremia was detected in 342 (42.1%) patients. There is no correlation
   between anti-HCV S/CO ratio and HCV RNA level. The samples with an S/Co
   ratio between 1 and 4 (271/271, 100%) were all HCV RNA negative. The
   area under the ROC curve of anti-HCV S/CO ratio was 0.8714 and the
   maximal Youden index was 0.681 at an optimal cutoff S/CO ratio value of
   8.99.
   Conclusions: With the cutoff value of 1.0, the Architect anti-HCV assay
   showed excellent sensitivity but poor specificity in predicting HCV
   viremia. An S/Co ratio of 8.99 was optimal for further confirmation
   testing of HCV viremia.

AB The complex problem of risk factors has greatly increased globally due
   to the quick ever-changing digital era. The development of suitable
   techniques for facilitating the performance of risk management in the
   financial service domain is thus an urgent task, especially in today's
   highly turbulent business environment. The development of such
   techniques involves many factors like the classical multiple criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) problem, but too many factors surrounding the
   users will confuse them and lead to improper judgments. To deal with
   this critical task, this study proposes a fusion multiple rule-based
   decision-making (MRDM) approach that integrates a rule-based technique
   [i.e., the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST) with particle swarm
   optimization (PSO)] into MCDM (i.e., DEMATEL, DANP, and modified-VIKOR)
   techniques that can help decision makers choose the optimal model
   necessary for achieving aspiration-level effects in a risk control
   strategy. The results indicate that the improvement priority, which runs
   in the order as (a) AI algorithm model, (c) AI regulatory and
   compliance, (d) AI conduct, and (b) AI technology based on the magnitude
   of the impact, can effectively improve the performance of AI-driven risk
   management for financial service firms.

AB This paper digests the influences of financial transparency and media
   coverage in the Chinese stock market. In China, media performs under a
   regulatory system and media information is regarded as the direction of
   news. In addition, the Chinese market is dominated by retail investors
   and financial information is always manipulated, so the reliability of
   financial information is quite intriguing. The effect of ostensible
   financial information on the stock market through the media hype is a
   crucial issue. We employ media and transparency to analyze over 3,000
   stocks in China. First of all, the Chinese stock market is characterized
   by significantly negative momentum profit and thus exhibits price
   reversal. However, when high media coverage and high transparency
   jointly come into play, the significantly negative momentum profit turns
   to be significantly positive. This dramatic change alters the price
   reversal to be price momentum. By contrast, low media coverage and low
   transparency still result in price reversal.

AB Using the setting of corporate site visits, this study examines the
   information interpretation role of board secretaries on market
   information efficiency. We find that the presence of the board secretary
   during corporate site visits can significantly improve the information
   content of such visits. From the perspective of information
   interpretation ability, when the board secretary has a dual role,
   receives high relative compensation, and has a high level of education,
   his or her participation in site visits has a greater effect on
   improving the informativeness of such visits. From the perspective of
   information asymmetry, the information interpretation role of the board
   secretary is more pronounced when the level of information asymmetry
   between the firm and its investors is high. Further analysis shows that
   when the board secretary attends more site visits, the level of analyst
   forecast error is lower. In summary, we confirm the information
   interpretation role of board secretaries, which is useful for opening
   the "black box" of their participation in the information assimilation
   process and for better understanding of how to improve market
   information efficiency. (C) 2021 Sun Yat-sen University. Production and

AB This article presents an integrated power control strategy (IPCS) for a
   variable frequency speed regulation system, which consists of a
   back-to-back converter and a small film dc-link capacitor. Due to the
   lack of large-capacity energy storage components in the dc bus, there is
   a strong power coupling between the rectifier and the inverter. The
   dynamic response is limited and dc-link voltage oscillates because the
   traditional method controls rectification and inversion separately. The
   IPCS is proposed to achieve dynamic balance of the system power through
   synchronous control of the rectifier and inverter. High conversion
   efficiency guarantees the power balance of the rectifier and inverter
   meanwhile reduces the dc bus voltage ripple. To further reduce the
   dc-link voltage ripple and maintain the stability of the dc-link voltage
   under step changes of load, a virtual inertia control method is
   proposed, which consists of a virtual resistance control block and a
   virtual capacitor control block. As a result, the dc-link voltage ripple
   and the total harmonic distortion of the dc-link current can be
   improved. Simulations and experimental results are given to provide
   further validation of the proposed IPCS under different operating
   scenarios.

AB Absolute moment block truncated coding (AMBTC) is a lossy image
   compression technique aiming at low computational cost, and has been
   widely studied. Previous studies have investigated the performance
   improvement of AMBTC; however, they often over describe the details of
   image blocks during encoding, causing an increase in bitrate. In this
   paper, we propose an efficient method to improve the compression
   performance by classifying image blocks into flat, smooth, and complex
   blocks according to their complexity. Flat blocks are encoded by their
   block means, while smooth blocks are encoded by a pair of adjusted
   quantized values and an index pointing to one of the k representative
   bitmaps. Complex blocks are encoded by three quantized values and a
   ternary map obtained by a clustering algorithm. Ternary indicators are
   used to specify the encoding cases. In our method, the details of most
   blocks can be retained without significantly increasing the bitrate.
   Experimental results show that, compared with prior works, the proposed
   method achieves higher image quality at a better compression ratio for
   all of the test images.

AB Dynamic (or say, time-varying) problems have been a hot spot of research
   recently. As a general form of matrix inverse, dynamic Moore-Penrose
   inverse solving has received more and more attention owing to its broad
   applications. The approaches based on neural networks have become a
   popular solution to various dynamic matrix-related problems including
   dynamic Moore-Penrose inverse. However, existing neural models either
   only achieve infinite-time instead of finite-time convergence, or are
   sensitive to noises. Therefore, finite-time convergent neural model,
   which is simultaneously capable of addressing the noises, is desperately
   needed for dynamic Moore-Penrose inverse solving. To do that, in this
   paper, a novel evolution formula is designed based on the widely
   investigated Zhang neural network (ZNN). Accordingly, two modified ZNN
   models (MZNN), namely MZNN-R and MZNN-L models, are proposed and
   analyzed for the right and left dynamic Moore-Penrose inversion of
   full-rank matrices, respectively. In addition to providing detailed
   theoretical analyses on the desired finite-time convergence and
   noise-depression properties of the proposed two models, we also perform
   two numerical examples for further verification. Furthermore, to
   illustrate the potential of MZNN models in practical applications, two
   path-tracking control examples are also presented via a two-dimensional
   planar three-link and a three-dimensional Kinova Jaco(2) redundant robot
   manipulator. The feasibility, extraordinary efficacy, and superiority of
   the proposed MZNN models for dynamic Moore-Penrose inverse solving are
   corroborated by both theoretical results and simulation observations.

   Emotional intelligence is related to emotional labor, and emotional
   labor strategy is the means to optimize the emotional labor process.
   College Teachers' emotional labor strategies include five basic
   strategies: self-awareness, self-regulation, self motivation, empathy,
   and social skills. It can stimulate college teachers' real emotions and
   deep acting behaviors, help to avoid job burnout and enhance their sense
   of professional identity and happiness. From the perspective of
   emotional labor, it is of great significance to study the working state
   of young teachers and put forward the strategies to improve their

   more than 75,000,000 transactions of one E-commerce company from January
   2013 to June 2019, we analyze the economic impact of the holiday season,
   the relationship between price and sales, etc. Furthermore, we utilize

   constructed, in which the major stakeholders include the government,
   investors, creditors, contractors, operators, and so on. Carry on
   hinterland area analysis and hinterland goods quantity forecast. Then,
   the constraints of the optimal decision model for diversified port
   investment are determined, including cost-benefit constraints,
   ecological carrying capacity constraints, supply and demand constraints,
   integer programming constraints. Finally, the optimal decision model of
   diversified port investment is constructed according to the given
   constraints. The model consists of demand forecasting module, income
   module, cost module and investment and financing module. In order to
   prove that the profit performance of the optimized decision model is
   good, the traditional model is compared with the model. The experimental
   results show that the model is better than the traditional model.

AB The expansion of tourism demand and the rapid growth of tourism industry
   objectively promote the tourism development and utilization of nature
   reserves. At present, there are various difficulties in the practical
   application of tourism environmental capacity assessment technology in
   nature reserves. This article attempts to carry out tourism monitoring
   and management in protected areas by combining 3D sensor image
   acquisition and environmental capacity assessment technology. First of
   all, this paper proposes a dynamic monitoring plan for the ecological
   environment of the reserve using 3D sensor image acquisition technology,
   and realizes the monitoring of tourists in the reserve and the
   collection of natural environment data. Secondly, this article proposes
   a new natural reserve tourism environment capacity assessment and
   pricing plan, and takes the Changtang National Park high-end tourism
   project as an example, and discusses its application in the form of a
   case study. This program provides a new solution for balancing the
   economic and environmental benefits of the reserve. Through simulation
   tests and questionnaire surveys, we found that the program can
   effectively improve the nature protection and tourism inspection work in
   the reserve.

AB We show the effect of investor anxiety on momentum in the Chinese stock
   market. In this market dominated by retail investors, we examine the
   momentum profits in 900 types of daily testing periods. We find
   prevalent price reversals in the long formation and holding periods in
   the Chinese A-share market. Compared to Goyal and Wahal (2015), Wang and
   Xie (2010), and Kang et al. (2002) who found no momentum, our novel
   finding from a daily basis is that the A-share market presents price
   momentum within the short formation and holding periods. We first test
   the momentum profits under different strengths of anxiety in the A-share
   market. The stocks held by the least anxious investors elicit the
   strongest price momentum, whereas the stocks held by the most anxious
   investors encounter much weaker price momentum in the A-share market.
   According to our empirical outcomes, the A-share market overall exhibits
   higher anxiety and weaker momentum, whereas the B-share market embodies
   milder anxiety and stronger momentum. From the results of single market
   and cross-market comparisons, the intrinsic anxiety of retail investors
   is an essential factor stimulating the Chinese stock market to be prone
   to price reversals.

   impossible to transfer the cost of waste water treatment to consumers.
   Discharging wastewater illegally became the usual behaviours of leather
   factories in past decades in China. The Environmental Supervision
   Department of China was faced with the dilemma of 'If we let it be,
   there will be a mess' and 'if we take strict supervision the enterprises
   could not survive due to the high treatment cost'. We have to tolerate
   and accept the fact that environmental pollution is an inevitable
   consequence of extensive economic construction. In order to reduce and
   control pollution, the Supervision Department are strengthening
   supervision while accelerating the upgrading of leather production
   equipment, supporting enterprises to improve production process, guiding
   the mergers and reorganizations of the leather manufacturing industry,
   and seeking the dialectical unity of industry and public interests

AB This paper proposes a reversible authentication scheme for demosaiced
   images with the capability to approximately recover original contents of
   tampered parts. The existing methods protect the marked images to a
   large extent; however, they cannot detect some intentional
   modifications, or lack the self-recovery capability of tampered regions.
   The proposed method uses the most significant bits (MSBs) of sampled
   components to generate recovery codes, and embeds them into the least
   significant bits (LSBs) of rebuilt components. The MSBs of rebuilt
   components are adjusted to reduce the embedding distortion. The
   authentication codes are generated by hashing the MSBs of adjusted
   rebuilt components, and are embedded into their LSBs. By analyzing the
   extracted authentication and recovery codes, the tampered regions can be
   localized, and the original contents can be approximately recovered. If
   the marked image is untampered, the original demosaiced image can be
   exactly reconstructed. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed method not only provides an excellent marked image quality but
   also achieves a satisfactory detection and recovery results.

AB Signal buffering services such as contention resolution and congestion
   avoidance are essential in optical packet switching networks. In this
   paper, an optical memory scheme based on spectral amplitude coding (SAC)
   and complementary code keying (CCK) is proposed to increase the buffer
   capacity. CCK is applied to packet buffering by selecting an available
   code set and encoding the payload bits with either an SAC signal or its
   complementarity. The capacity constraint is effectively released, as the
   usable codes for queuing packets are twice those for the conventional
   code-domain buffers. To minimize system costs by reducing the codec
   number, a shared structure based on an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG),
   which is capable of processing both the typical and complimentary coded
   signals simultaneously, is also investigated.

AB Although previous research has confirmed that climate change impacts
   tourism systems, few studies have explored the differences in tourists'
   adaptation intentions in response to diverse climate change perceptions.
   Therefore, this study compared two tourist groups with high and low
   climate change perception levels to understand their adaptation
   intentions based on protection motivation theory. A valid sample
   totaling 696 domestic tourists visiting Kenting National Park in Taiwan
   was surveyed. The results revealed that the low-perception tourist group
   had externally-oriented adaptation, with the perceived external
   environment or information dissemination impacting adaptation intention.
   However, the high-perception tourist group's adaptation intention was
   internally-oriented, relating to their self-control and personal core
   values. This study's findings contribute to the literature on different
   psychological viewpoints for understanding tourists' adaptation
   intentions based on the protection motivation theory in the context of
   climate change. Destination management organizations should consider the
   responding adaptation intention of different tourists and formulate
   corresponding environmental destination management strategies.

   analysis provides solid results and demonstrates that the higher the

   and the lower the risk of political downfall, which indicated that
   deputy mayors who started their careers in grassroots-level governments
   were associated with the lowest probabilities of promotion and highest

   belief. Study 1 indicates that the boycott intention is higher when the
   participants perceive the fan-celebrity relationship to be stronger.
   Study 2 indicates that power distance belief moderates the effect of
   relationship strength on the extent of generated internal attribution
   and thus influences boycott intention. Study 3 indicates that the

AB Background:
   Compassion has long been advocated as a fundamental element in nursing
   practice and education. However, defining and translating compassion
   into caring practice by nursing students who are new to the clinical
   practice environment as part of their educational journey remain
   unclear.
   Objectives:
   The aim of this study was to explore how Chinese baccalaureate nursing
   students define and characterize compassionate care as they participate
   in their clinical practice.
   Methods:
   A descriptive qualitative study design was used involving a
   semi-structured in-depth interview method and qualitative content
   analysis. Twenty senior year baccalaureate nursing students were
   interviewed during their clinical practicum experience at four teaching
   hospitals.
   Ethical considerations:
   Permission to conduct the study was received from the Institutional
   Review Boards and the participating hospitals.
   Results:
   Baccalaureate nursing students defined and characterized compassionate
   care as a union of "empathy" related to a nurse's desire to "alleviate
   patients' suffering," "address individualized care needs," "use
   therapeutic communication," and "promote mutual benefits with patients."
   Students recognized that the "practice environment" was characterized by
   nurse leaders' interpersonal relations, role modeling by nurses and
   workloads which influenced the practice of compassionate care by nursing
   personnel.
   Conclusion:
   Compassionate care is crucial for patients, nurses, and students in
   their professional development as well as the development of the nursing
   profession. In order to provide compassionate care, a positive practice
   environment promoted by hospital administrators is needed. This also
   includes having an adequate workforce of nurses who can role model
   compassionate care to students in their preceptor role while meeting the
   needs of their patients.

   issue that threatens human health. The World Health Organization (WHO)
   estimated that air pollution kills several million people worldwide each
   year. Researchers from various areas and governments and enterprises
   have invested many resources in investigating and reducing air
   pollution. Air Quality Index (AQI) is one of the essential indexes
   indicating air quality or the level of air pollution. A new dataset,
   including hourly AQI information recorded by 1,615 observation sites
   covering China from 2015 to 2019, is constructed. Several methods,
   including linear model and state-of-art techniques, such as Back
   Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),
   Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and
   Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), are adopted to forecast
   hourly AQI. The performance of these techniques is evaluated, and
   experiments show that the BiLSTM gives the best performance.

AB Online posts have gradually become a major carrier of network public
   opinion in social media, and the social network hotspots are the
   important basis for the study of network public opinion. Therefore, it
   is significant to extract hotspots for monitoring Internet public
   opinion from online posts textual big data. However, the current hotspot
   extraction methods are focused on the users' features that are based on
   textual big data with spam and low-quality content. Meanwhile, these
   methods seldomly consider the time span of posts and the popularity of
   users. Accordingly, this article presents a hotspots information
   extraction hybrid solution of online posts' textual data. Firstly, a
   filtering strategy to obtain more high-quality textual data is designed.
   Secondly, the topic hot degree is presented by considering the average
   number of replies and the popularity of the participant. Thirdly, an
   improved co-word analysis technology is used to search the same topic
   posts and Bisecting k-means clustering algorithm using repliers'
   popularity and key posts are designed for studying and monitoring the
   hotspots of online posts in a valid big data environment. Finally, the
   proposed algorithms are verified in experiments by extracting the
   hotspots of online posts from the dataset. The results show that the
   data filtering strategy can help to obtain more valuable information and
   decrease the computing time. The results also demonstrate that the
   proposed solution can help to obtain hotspots comparing the traditional
   methods, and the hot degree can reflect the trend of the online post by
   comparing the traditional methods.

AB To solve the problems of poor real-time collision accuracy and low
   efficiency of modeling in the virtual reality environment, we propounded
   a depth image-based 3D modeling system and a hybrid intelligent
   collision detection algorithm. With the development of the 3D animation
   interactive system as an example, this paper uses 3D modeling technology
   based on depth images to build single role models, then reorganizes and
   merges the models to form 3D scenes. The hybrid intelligent collision
   detection algorithm, which combines the quantum behavior particle swarm
   optimization algorithm and the differential algorithm, improves the
   collision detection efficiency and accuracy and realizes behavior
   control of the characters in the interactive system. The experimental
   result shows that the 3D modeling technology based on depth images has
   greatly improved the accuracy and quantity of model texture and motion
   rate. By comparing the hybrid intelligent collision detection algorithm,
   the QPSO algorithm, and the FDH bounding box for collision detection, we
   conclude that the algorithm used in this paper has a shorter average
   collision time, more stable role behavior control, and better
   robustness.

AB The state of Michigan, U.S.A., was awarded USD 1 million in March 2018
   for the Great Lakes Invasive Carp Challenge. The challenge sought new
   and novel technologies to function independently of or in conjunction
   with those fish deterrents already in place to prevent the movement of
   invasive carp species into the Great Lakes from the Illinois River
   through the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). Our team proposed an
   environmentally friendly, low-cost, vision-based fish recognition and
   separation system. The proposed solution won fourth place in the
   challenge out of 353 participants from 27 countries. The proposed
   solution includes an underwater imaging system that captures the fish
   images for processing, fish species recognition algorithm that identify
   invasive carp species, and a mechanical system that guides the fish
   movement and restrains invasive fish species for removal. We used our
   evolutionary learning-based algorithm to recognize fish species, which
   is considered the most challenging task of this solution. The algorithm
   was tested with a fish dataset consisted of four invasive and four
   non-invasive fish species. It achieved a remarkable 1.58% error rate,
   which is more than adequate for the proposed system, and required only a
   small number of images for training. This paper details the design of
   this unique solution and the implementation and testing that were
   accomplished since the challenge.

AB The presented paper is the first attempt to apply deep learning for
   predicting the frequency characteristics of a magneto-electro-elastic
   (MEE) annular nano/microdisk (MEEAD). The optimum amount of the factors
   participating in the mechanism of the fully connected neural network are
   achieved through the optimizer based on the momentum. The positive side
   of the mentioned approach employed in this investigation would be due to
   its high accuracy along with lower epochs required for training the
   multi-layered network. This scrutinization would be semi-computational
   research that estimates the vibrational behavior of a MEEAD employing a
   non-classical continuum model known as the modified couple stress (MCS)
   model. First order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and shell model would
   be provided for presenting their displacement fields. Then,
   Kelvin-Voight theory has been applied to model the viscoelastic
   foundation. Its non-classical governing equations, as well as related
   boundary conditions (BCs) of small-scaled MEEAD, would be achieved by
   considering the symmetric spinning gradient along with higher-order
   stress tensors for the strain energy. The provided non-classical theory
   would be able to capture the small scale in the MEEAD employing just one
   length scale of a material factor, then, the mathematical modeling of
   MEEAD according to the classical theory would be able to be recovered
   from the provided model by eliminating the material length scale factor.
   Ultimately, the non-classical governing equations would be solved by
   applying the generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) approach for
   multifarious BCs. Moreover, parametric research has been conducted to
   analyze the influences of the viscoelastic foundation, length scale
   factor, geometry of MEE, radial and circumferential mode number, radius
   ratio, and BCs on the frequency behavior of the MEEAD by applying MCST.
   The outcomes reveal that there would be a crucial radius ratio in which
   the relationship between these elements and crucial inserted voltage
   alters from direct to indirect relation.

AB The existing tamper detection schemes for absolute moment block
   truncation coding (AMBTC) compressed images are able to detect the
   tampering. However, the marked image qualities of these schemes can be
   enhanced, and their authentication methods may fail to detect some
   special tampering. We propose a secure AMBTC tamper detection scheme
   that preserves high image fidelity with excellent detectability. In the
   proposed approach, a bit in bitmaps of AMBTC codes is sequentially
   toggled to generate a set of authentication codes. The one that causes
   the least distortion is embedded into the quantization levels with the
   guidance of a key-generated reference table (RT). Without the correct
   key, the same reference table cannot be constructed. Therefore, the
   proposed method is able to detect various kinds of malicious tampering,
   including those special tampering techniques designed for RT-based
   authentication schemes. The proposed method not only offers better image
   quality, but also provides an excellent and satisfactory detectability
   as compared with previous works.

AB Under the Basel II and Basel III agreements, the probability of default
   (PD) is a key parameter used in calculating expected credit loss (ECL),
   which is typically defined as: PD x Loss Given Default x Exposure at
   Default. In practice or in regulatory requirements, gross domestic
   product (GDP) has been adopted in the PD estimation model. Due to the
   problem of excessive fluctuation and highly volatile ECL estimation,
   models that produce satisfactory PD and thus ECL estimations in the
   context of existing risk management techniques are lacking. In this
   study, we explore the usage of the credit default swap index (CDX), a
   market's expectation of future PD, as a predictor of the default rate
   (DR). By comparing the goodness-of-fit of logistic regression, several
   conclusions are drawn. Firstly, in general, GDP has considerable
   explanatory power for the default rate which is consistent with current
   models in practice. Secondly, although both GDP and CDX fit the DR well
   for rating B class, CDX has a significantly better fit of DR for ratings
   [A, Baa, Ba]. Thirdly, compared with low-rated companies, the
   relationship between the DR and GDP is relatively weak for rating A.
   This phenomenon implies that, in addition to using macroeconomic
   variables and firm-specific explanatory variables in the PD estimation
   model, high-rated companies exhibit a greater need to use market
   supplemental information, such as CDX, to capture the changes in the DR.

AB This paper digests the relationship between the manipulation of losses
   and price reversals in the Chinese stock market. Timely loss recognition
   is involved in detecting the manipulation of losses, while price
   reversals are investigated by momentum profit. In addition, two-way
   sorting momentum portfolios are employed to connect manipulating losses
   with price reversals. Companies with low timely loss recognition
   aggressively manipulate their losses, and our results indicate that they
   generate much more significantly negative momentum profits. As a
   consequence, they cannot build up any immunity against reversal risks
   and encounter much higher reversal risks than other companies. Such
   findings still hold after the risk adjustments using asset pricing
   models come into play and when controlling for the calendar effect. This
   research indeed suggests that investors should exercise caution when
   dealing with companies whose financial information is too positive. Such
   companies may dress up their financial reports, thereby significantly
   increasing the risks associated with price reversals.

   can introduce a fusion intelligent system that involves data envelopment

AB This article comprehensively considers timeliness of emergency rescue
   and cost constraints. Based on the transportation costs from the rescue
   center to the disaster site and the cost of setting up the rescue
   center, golden rescue timeis taken into account. The penalty cost caused
   by losing the golden rescue time is considered, thereby quantifying
   timeliness as another dimension of cost. The problem is solved using
   K-means clustering algorithm and fruit fly algorithm (FOA). With the
   purpose of minimizing the weighted sum of construction costs,
   transportation costs and penalty costs of emergency rescue centers,
   suitable location is selected for establishment of emergency rescue
   center. Finally, modified two algorithms (RWFOA and MFOA) are compared
   in optimization performance. The K-means clustering analysis and FOA are
   used to simplify and solve the original model, which can solve complex
   problems. In comparison between RWFOA and MFOA, the optimal value of
   MFOA is lower.

AB The existing probability based reversible authentication schemes for
   demosaiced images embed authentication codes into rebuilt components of
   image pixels. The original demosaiced image can be totally recovered if
   the marked image is unaltered. Although these schemes offer the goal of
   pixel-wise tamper detection, the generated authentication codes are
   irrelevant to the image pixels, causing some undetectable intentional
   alterations. The proposed method pre-processes the rebuilt components of
   demosaiced images and hashes them to generate authentication codes. With
   the guide of a randomly-generated reference table, authentication codes
   are embedded into the rebuilt components of demosaiced images. Since the
   distortions of image pixels are sensitive to the embedded authentication
   codes, the proposed method further alters the pre-processed pixels to
   generate a set of authentication codes. One of the authentication codes
   that minimizes the distortion is embedded to generate marked demosaiced
   images. The results show that the proposed method offers a better image
   quality than prior state-of-the-art works, and is capable of detecting a
   variety of tampering.

AB Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) can effectively solve the
   code-tangling and code-scattering which are caused by crosscutting
   attributes, However, much work is presented on the programming and the
   implementation phase, and few works have addressed the early model
   stages. In this paper, we do research on the requirements engineering
   phase of software by using AOP technology. First in the requirements
   analysis phase, we identified the functional requirements and
   non-functional requirements by the separation of concerns, then to
   realize the functional requirements with components and the
   non-functional requirements with aspects. Then we represent the
   components and aspects by combining with the formal language Aspect-Z
   which have characteristics of accurate description; As actions accompany
   with conflicts while two or more aspects effect on the same joint point
   synchronously, we propose a method to solve by defining aspects priority

AB Hydrogel is a promising soft matter attracting intensive study in the
   field of biomaterial, flexible electronics and soft robotics. The
   creation of a crosslinking polymer network is vital in fabricating
   hydrogel. A new method of fabrication brings more choices to the field.
   In this work, we show that the freezing-thawing method can be applied to
   prepare high-performance calcium-polyacrylic acid hydrogel. We
   polymerize acrylic acid in calcium chloride solution and obtain a soft
   and weak hydrogel; after the freezing-thawing treatment, the performance
   of the hydrogel improves profoundly. The freeze-thawed hydrogel can
   sustain strain up to 1100% and fracture at a stress of 0.6 MPa. This
   hydrogel also shows low hysteresis less than 5% at 200% strain and good
   recovery up to 800% strain. The hydrogel is strengthened by the increase
   of ionic bonds between cation and polymer chain during the freezing
   treatment. The same strategy can be applied to increase the inter-chain
   interaction of other hydrogels and thus provides more possibility in the
   design of hydrogel network.

AB alpha-Thalassemia (alpha-thal) is one of the most common genetic
   diseases in Southern China. Although more than 300 alpha-thal mutations
   have been reported in the world, the mutation spectrum is still not
   comprehensive. In this study, a novel mutation (HBA1: c.349G>T) in a
   newborn (proband) was first found by next-generation sequencing (NGS).
   Subsequently, hematological analysis and thalassemia genetic testing
   were performed for the family members. The results showed that both the
   proband and her mother were heterozygotes for this novel mutation and
   presented abnormal hematological indices. Based on the features observed
   in clinical practice, this novel mutation was considered as a type of
   alpha-thal variation.

AB In today's big-data era, enterprises are able to generate complex and
   non-structured information that could cause considerable challenges for
   CPA firms in data analysis and to issue improper audited reports within
   the required period. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled auditing
   technology not only facilitates accurate and comprehensive auditing for
   CPA firms, but is also a major breakthrough in auditing's new
   environment. Applications of an AI-enabled auditing technique in
   external auditing can add to auditing efficiency, increase financial
   reporting accountability, ensure audit quality, and assist
   decision-makers in making reliable decisions. Strategies related to the
   adoption of an AI-enabled auditing technique by CPA firms cover the
   classical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) task (i.e., several
   perspectives/criteria must be considered). To address this critical
   task, the present study proposes a fusion multiple rule-based decision
   making (MRDM) model that integrates rule-based technique (i.e., the
   fuzzy rough set theory (FRST) with ant colony optimization (ACO)) into
   MCDM techniques that can assist decision makers in selecting the best
   methods necessary to achieve the aspired goals of audit success. We also
   consider potential implications for articulating suitable strategies
   that can improve the adoption of AI-enabled auditing techniques and that
   target continuous improvement and sustainable development.

AB This study introduces a dynamic decision architecture that involves
   three steps for corporate performance forecasting as such bad
   performance has been widely recognized as the main trigger for a
   financial crisis. Step-1: performance evaluation and integration;
   Step-2: forecasting model construction; and Step-3: knowledge
   generation. First, the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory
   (DEMATEL) is incorporated with balanced scorecards (BSC) to discover the
   complicated/intertwined relationships among BSC's four perspectives. To
   overcome the problem of BSC that cannot yield a specific direction, the
   study then employs data envelopment analysis (DEA). Apart from previous
   studies that utilize an all embracing one-stage model, this set-up
   extends it to a two-stage model that calculates the performance scores
   for each BSC perspective. By doing so, users can realize a company's
   weaknesses and strengths and identify possible paths toward efficiency.
   VIKOR is subsequently used to summarize all scores into a synthesized
   one. Second, the analyzed outcomes are then fed into random vector
   functional-link (RVFL) networks to establish the forecasting model. To
   handle the opaque nature of RVFL, the instance learning method is
   conducted to extract the implicit decision logics. Finally, the
   introduced architecture, tested by real cases, offers a promising
   alternative for performance evaluation and forecasting.

AB This work applies a data-driven coding method for prediction of the
   COVID-19 spreading profile in any given population that shows an initial
   phase of epidemic progression. Based on the historical data collected
   for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters
   of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model
   obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of
   transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing
   the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete
   set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the
   corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the
   future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of
   the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows
   that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before mid April,
   the end of March and the end of May 2020, and that the percentage of
   population infected in each city or region will be less than 0.01%, 0.5%
   and 0.5%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.

AB In China, most of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms do not possess
   operational sustainability due to excessive defaults. To address this
   problem, the conflict of interests among P2P lending participants is
   discussed using a stakeholder approach. An evolutionary game model (EGM)
   of three players is developed to analyse the interactions among
   regulatory authorities, P2P lending platforms, and borrowers. Then, the
   asymptotic of the equilibrium and evolutionary stability strategies of
   the EGM are analysed. Results indicate that either the P2P lending
   platforms or borrowers will choose "noncompliant operation" or "default"
   strategies from a short-term perspective, and the strict supervision of
   the P2P lending platform in the short term is necessary for the
   sustainable operation of the platform. When supervision is intensified
   in the early stage and regulatory pressure becomes a normal state, P2P
   lending platforms and borrowers will actively select "compliant
   operation" and "repayment" strategies even if there is a lack of
   regulation in the future. Meanwhile, the behavioural strategies of P2P
   lending participants can be changed to conform to the sustainability of
   P2P lending by reducing the costs of strict supervision and increasing
   the damage caused by general supervision, reward and punishment
   coefficient for P2P lending platforms, repayment incentives of
   borrowers, and defaulting opportunity costs. Finally, suggestions for
   regulating the behaviours of P2P lending participants and promoting
   sustainability of P2P lending industry are discussed.

AB Introduction Maternal delivery at home without skilled care at birth is
   a major public health issue. The current study aimed to assess the
   various contributing and eliminating factors of maternal delivery at
   home in India. The reasons for not delivering at healthcare facilities
   were also explored. Methods The study used the National Family Health
   Surveys (NFHS)-4 (2015-2016) data from states and union territories of
   India for analysis. A national representative sample of 699,686 women of
   reproductive age group (15-49 years) was used. Cross-tabulation and
   multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results The
   prevalence of home delivery in India was 22%, among which 34% of women
   believed that institutional delivery was not a necessity. Financial
   constraints, lack of proper transportation facilities, non-accessibility
   of healthcare institutions and not getting permission from family
   members were the main reasons cited by the women for delivering at home.
   The proportion of home deliveries was much higher among women from more
   disadvantaged socioeconomic areas than women from less disadvantaged
   socioeconomic areas. Domestic violence and partner control were
   essential factors contributing to the prevalence of home delivery.
   However, the women who owned mobile phones and used a short message
   service (SMS) facility delivered at home less often. Conclusion
   Policymakers should focus more on the women living in disadvantaged
   socioeconomic areas and other marginalised populations with less
   education and low economic levels to provide them with optimum delivery
   care utilisation. Strengthening of public healthcare facilities and more
   effective use of skilled birth attendents and their networking are
   essential steps. Electronic and economic empowerment of women should be
   emphasised to bring about a significant reduction in the proportion of
   home deliveries in India.

   questionnaires were collected from Huaqiangbei Commercial Zone, which
   was considered to be a naturally formed industrial cluster in China.
   This study applies structural equation modelling with the analysis of
   moment structure to test the hypotheses. The findings of this study show
   that there is different development between intentionally and naturally
   formed industrial clusters. In the intentionally formed industrial
   cluster, the results display that global connections positively
   influence formal cooperation, which in turn, positively results in
   explorative and exploitative innovation. In this model, local
   connections positively influence formal cooperation, which in turn,
   positively leads to explorative and exploitative innovations. In
   contrast, in the naturally formed industrial cluster, the result shows
   that global connections positively influence both formal and informal
   cooperation, which in turn, positively result in explorative and
   exploitative innovations. In the model, local connections positively
   influence informal cooperation, which in turn, positively leads to
   explorative and exploitative innovations.

   equation modeling was adopted. Findings This study found a positive
   relationship between COO and CBE and a negative relationship between EA
   and CBE. CBE exhibits a partial mediating effect in the relationship
   between COO and PI and a full suppression effect on EA toward PI.
   Research limitations/implications This research is limited to China;
   future research could extend this framework to the United States.
   Practical implications This study contributes to relationship marketing
   knowledge. Furthermore, it provides new tools for multinational
   corporations to deploy their marketing strategies and avoid negative
   consequences stemming from the EA effect in the Chinese market following
   the US-China trade war. Originality/value This study is the first to

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to use the Macau gaming industry
   as a case study to discuss the multifaceted relationships involving
   experiential quality, experiential relationship quality and future
   experiential intentions.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, 566 usable responses were
   collected from casino gamblers who had gaming experience in one casino
   of Macau.
   Findings - According to the study results, the dimensions of
   experiential quality (hedonics, involvement, surprise, fun, gambler
   contact and physical environment) had a positive effect on experiential
   satisfaction, which in turn led to experiential trust. Both experiential
   trust and experiential satisfaction positively influenced experiential
   commitment. Moreover, experiential trust, experiential satisfaction and
   experiential commitment positively affected future experiential
   intentions.
   Originality/value - The main contribution of this research is that it
   has added to the body of knowledge about the interplay between the
   dimensions of experiential quality, the dimension of experiential
   relationship quality and future experiential intentions, which can be
   fruitful for the gaming industry.

AB Cultural and creative products are incredibly diverse that difficult to
   mass-produce and fail to meet market demands. The unique characteristics
   and the cultural and sales value of cultural and creative products must
   be highlighted through the application of multifunctional design. As a
   scientific approach, the Delphi method and fuzzy logic theory were
   applied to create a multiattribute DFuzzy decision model for cultural
   and creative product design. This model is intended to enable objective,
   quantitative auxiliary decision evaluation for product design, providing
   a reference for optimization of commodity production. Fuzzy logic is one
   of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and quantifies the fuzzy
   semantics of human languages. The Delphi method enables group
   decision-making among experts, thus contributing to the scientific and
   objective nature of the DFuzzy model. The 16 Delphi experts invited to
   participate in this study were the chief executive officers in the
   cultural and creative industry, local cultural management commissioners,
   and domain knowledge professors, all of whom had at least 12 years of
   experience in cultural and creative industry development. The experts
   reached a consensus regarding 19 preliminary criteria identified through
   a three-round Delphi process. The four criteria suitable for the DFuzzy
   model were determined to be cultural images, innovation and creativity,
   customer demand, and city charm. The model was then applied to evaluate
   three cases, a multifunctional scale ruler, a toy robot, and an
   agricultural specialty product. Another consensus was then reached by
   the experts through a two-round Delphi process, and the four criteria
   were validated. Thus, the objective quantitative calculation function of
   the DFuzzy model was confirmed along with its applicability for
   auxiliary decision-making in cultural and creative product design and
   education.

   coherence (MWC) are applied to the available tourism data. Results
   indicate that there is a strong short-term comovement between tourism
   and its control variables at low, medium, and high frequencies between
   three tourism sectors in terms of PWC. As for MWC, tourism activities
   are generally highly correlated over time and frequency bands and become

   to assess the factors related to the experience of IPVAW and attitude
   towards wife beating among women. The study also assessed whether a
   family history of violence is a risk factor for experiencing IPVAW. The
   study used the Benin Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18 data for
   analyses. A national representative sample of 4488 ever married women
   was selected to respond to a domestic violence and abuse questionnaire.
   Cross-tabulation and multivariate logistic regression analyses were
   performed. The prevalence of IPVAW experience in Benin was as follows:
   emotional violence, 35.4%; physical violence, 18.4%; and sexual
   violence, 8.2%. Older age, rural residence, the practice of Vodoun
   religion, living in a household headed by a male member, family history
   of domestic violence, and attitudes towards wife beating were
   significantly associated with the prevalence of IPVAW. Thirty-two
   percent of women supported wife beating. Women residing in urban areas,
   having higher educational qualification, higher socioeconomic status,
   and no family history of domestic violence were less likely to support
   wife beating. Policymakers should place emphasis on evidence-based
   prevention programs, gender equality, women empowerment, and policy
   priority for curbing IPVAW.

AB Pipe elbow joints exist in almost every piping system supporting many
   important applications such as clean water supply. However, spatial
   information of the elbow joints is rarely extracted and analyzed from
   observations such as point cloud data obtained from laser scanning due
   to lack of a complete geometric model that can be applied to different
   types of joints. In this paper, we proposed a novel geometric model and
   several model adaptions for typical elbow joints including the 90
   degrees and 45 degrees types, which facilitates the use of 3D point
   clouds of the elbow joints collected from laser scanning. The model
   comprises translational, rotational, and dimensional parameters, which
   can be used not only for monitoring the joints' geometry but also other
   applications such as point cloud registrations. Both simulated and real
   datasets were used to verify the model, and two applications derived
   from the proposed model (point cloud registration and mounting bracket
   detection) were shown. The results of the geometric fitting of the
   simulated datasets suggest that the model can accurately recover the
   geometry of the joint with very low translational (0.3 mm) and
   rotational (0.064 degrees) errors when +/- 0.02 m random errors were
   introduced to coordinates of a simulated 90 degrees joint (with diameter
   equal to 0.2 m). The fitting of the real datasets suggests that the
   accuracy of the diameter estimate reaches 97.2%. The joint-based
   registration accuracy reaches sub-decimeter and sub-degree levels for
   the translational and rotational parameters, respectively.

AB Reversible data hiding (RDH) with contrast enhancement (RDH-CE) is a
   special type of RDH in improving the subjective visual perception by
   enhancing the image contrast during the process of data embedding. In
   RDH-CE, data hiding is achieved via pairwise histogram expansion, and
   the embedding rate can be increased by performing multiple cycles of
   histogram expansions. However, when embedding rate gets high, human
   visible image degradation is observed. Previous work designed an upper
   bound of the embedding level for RDH-CE, which effectively avoids image
   over-sharping but offers limited embedding capacity. In this paper, a
   better tunable bound is designed to enhance the embedding capacity of
   RDH-CE by exploiting the characteristics of histogram distribution.
   Furthermore, the objective distortion introduced by histogram
   pre-shifting is minimized when the embedding level is no more than the
   upper bound, and the human visible degradation is minimized when the
   embedding level exceeds the limitation of the proposed upper bound.
   Experimental results validate that the proposed method provides
   appropriate upper bound of the embedding level, increases the effective
   embedding capacity and offers better image contrast.

   show that the extracted six CDS factors, including service commitment,
   dietary preferences, design styles, additional value, delicate
   information collection, and dining environments. Dietary preferences,
   service commitment and additional value factor are the most important
   CDS factors for restaurant customers in Taipei City. This study divides
   1,029 restaurant customers in Taipei City into three clusters based on
   the CDS factors through cluster analysis. The differences in the
   preferences and habits for dining services among three clusters have
   been discussed in the context in detail. Finally, this study develops
   eight service strategies and determines the order of execution of the
   eight service strategies for each cluster of customers.
   Originality/value The findings will help restaurant operators segment

AB Nearly all adaptive control techniques require that the control
   directions of dynamical systems are known in advance. In this paper, for
   a class of pure-feedback nonaffine discrete-time systems with unknown
   control directions (UCDs), a high-order neural network (HONN)-based
   adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) approach is presented to
   address a repetitive tracking control issue. The implicit function
   theorem is adopted to cope with the difficulty resulting from the
   nonaffine structure of control input. Employing a discrete Nussbaum-type
   function in the neural network weight adaptation law to suit the UCD, an
   HONN is used to iteratively estimate the ideal control signals. In
   addition, a novel dead-zone method is developed in the HONN-based
   adaptive ILC algorithm to enhance its robustness against nonrepetitive
   desired trajectories and random uncertainties in iterative initial
   errors and external disturbance. Consequently, the system output, except
   at the initial $n$ time instants, is demonstrated to asymptotically
   converge to an adjustable range of the desired trajectory along the
   iteration axis, while all of the system signals remain bounded during
   the entire ILC process. Two simulation examples show the feasibility of
   the adaptive ILC approach.

   on Absolute moment block truncation coding (AMBTC). Previous works do
   not take into account characteristics of the AMBTC compressed codes.
   Therefore, the qualities of marked and recovered images are not
   satisfactory. In this paper, we generate the recovery codes according to
   block similarities. The recovery codes are scrambled and stored in the
   bitmaps of smooth blocks using Matrix encoding. The bits in the bitmap
   are flipped to obtain a set of authentication codes. The code that
   causes the least error is embedded into the quantization values using
   the adaptive pixel pair matching technique (APPM). For those complex
   blocks, the authentication codes are generated from the bitmaps, and are
   embedded into the quantization values. After authenticating, the
   tampered blocks are recovered by untampered ones with the same cluster
   information. Some blocks that cannot be recovered in the previous stage
   are recovered by using the Side match technique. The experimental
   results show that our method provides better image quality and
   recoverability than prior works.

AB As social media shapes human behavior and social interactions,
   especially with the help of Big Data and artificial intelligence, it
   becomes an important site for policy and design interventions. Since no
   systematic review on social media research for intelligent HCI has been
   conducted, the article presents exploratory findings on a scientometric
   analysis of the literature at the intersections of social media and AI.
   By identifying and discussing the main and emerging disciplines and the
   related keywords from 2,443 articles along with more than 18,000
   citations, the findings show that while Twitter and Facebook have been
   the main platforms for study, Chinese social media platforms emerge as
   new sites of research with the COVID-19. Also, sentiment analysis
   appears to be the most prominent research practices, with implications
   on the issues of privacy, misinformation, depression, and mental
   health). Four key dimensions of social media are summarized as
   foundations for the proposed research agenda for intelligent HCI that is
   not only smart, but also fair and inclusive.

   quality and risk early warning (CSQ-REW) model" based on the service
   gap, competitive quality gap and failure mode and effects analysis.
   There are eight strategy patterns in the CSQ-REW model. This study uses
   two major wedding banquet halls in Taiwan as the cases to verify the
   CSQ-REW model. For Wedding Banquet Hall A (i.e. the benchmarking
   company), most service attributes of the "venue styles and layouts" and
   "dining delivery" factors are competitive advantages with a lower risk
   of service failure. Most service attributes of the "reassurance" factor
   are false advantages with a higher risk of service failure. This study
   expects that the strategic implications of service attributes of the
   wedding banquet halls can be evaluated and identified more specifically
   and effectively using the CSQ-REW model to improve the service quality.

AB Many markets include a product and a platform product, where the product
   can only achieve its intended functions and performance in conjunction
   with or under the operation of its platform, such as a video game can
   only run on its game console. The growth of the user population of these
   products or services is a kind of collective behaviour propagation
   phenomenon. Here, questions come: how can we describe the collective
   behaviour propagation as a function of time? How the endogenous and
   exogenous social effects influence the collective behaviour propagation
   and how to quantify these two effects? In order to answer all these
   questions, an ordinary differential equation model is proposed to
   describe the growth of the user population of this class of markets.
   Firstly, a networked community is constructed, where users and
   prospective users are considered as nodes, and their relationship
   provides the method of building edges. Then, two fundamental influences
   of decision-making can be realized based on the network. A useful
   application of the model can be conceived and illustrated by one new
   database containing weekly sales of 25,237 video games released in the
   home and handle consoles and personal computer in USA, UK, Germany,
   France and Japan from 1989 to 2018. Results show that historical sales
   profile of a video game follows the growth equation, and the numerical
   procedure for finding the model parameters allows the market size, and
   the relative effectiveness of customer service and promotional efforts
   to be estimated according to the available historical data.

AB Color image authentication is a method that allows the detection of
   tampered regions on images. Existing related works evaluated their
   performance based on visual quality and detection capability of the
   marked image, but the issue of grayscale invariance was ignored.
   However, many applications in image processing required the color image
   to first convert into a grayscale image before any further
   post-processing such as edge detection, color masking in Photoshop, and
   the display of e-ink. If the resulting image and the original image are
   different in their grayscale value, they might produce different
   outcomes after the post-processing. Therefore, how to maintain unchanged
   of the grayscale value has become an important issue. This paper
   presents a grayscale-invariance color image authentication technique. We
   proposed to embed the authentication code into two of three primary
   color channels and adjust the remaining one to remedy the distortion of
   grayscale value. The experimental results showed that, when embedding
   each four-bit authentication code into two color channels, the visual
   quality of the marked images has achieved an average 33.26 dB of peak
   signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) while providing a satisfactory
   detectability.

   integrating intercity migration data and testing capacity is developed

AB Triclosan (TCS) and Triclocarbon (TCC) are chlorinated synthetic

   fetuses are rare. In this study, we determine the concentrations of TCS
   and TCC in paired maternal serum, cord serum, maternal urine, and
   amniotic fluid samples collected from a cohort of 95 expecting
   mother-fetal pairs in Southern China. TCS and TCC are detected widely
   (detection rates: >76.9%) in maternal serum, cord serum, maternal urine,
   and amniotic fluid samples. TCS is found to be the predominant
   antimicrobial agent with median concentrations in maternal serum (1.5
   ng/mL) and cord serum (1.8 ng/mL) that are one order of magnitude higher
   than those of tcc in maternal serum (0.085 ng/mL) and cord serum (0.052
   ng/mL), respectively. Cord serum concentrations of tcs and tcc
   correlated well with the concentrations in maternal serum, which reflect
   the mothers' contribution to fetal exposure. The higher median ratio of
   cord serum/maternal serum(TCS) (0.95) compared to that of cord
   serum/maternal serum(TCC) (0.53) indicates high placental transmission
   ability of TCS. Moreover, the facility to penetrate the placental
   barrier and hard to depurate characteristics lead to the long residence
   of TCS in the fetal environment, causing great concern over the prenatal
   exposure risks during the critical window of fetal development. This
   study provides a novel contribution by increasing existing knowledge on
   the exposure assessment of TCS and TCC during pregnancy through the
   exploration of matched maternal-fetal samples. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Compassion is a core value of the nursing profession which enables
   nurses to empathize with and help alleviate patient suffering.
   Literature increasingly reports a lack of compassion in patient care by
   students and junior nurses; empirical knowledge regarding experiences of
   compassionate care among nursing students remains understudied. Student
   experiences in the clinical setting may influence their development of
   compassion competencies. This study explored the experiences of
   baccalaureate nursing students in gaining competencies to deliver
   compassionate care during their clinical practice year. A descriptive
   qualitative study using semistructured in-depth interviews was
   conducted. Thematic analysis was employed, generating six themes. The
   first three themes depict positive aspects of compassion development,
   including 'gaining patient acceptance,' 'motivation for professional
   growth,' and 'establishing an emotional bond with patients.' On the
   other hand, the other three themes capture the barriers to compassionate
   care, 'distrust,' 'fear of harm due to violence,' and 'heavy workload.'
   The positive and negative experiences shared by students indicate that
   hospital and nursing administrators need to foster a positive practice
   environment and nursing instructors should become role models to
   encourage compassionate care.

AB With the phase out of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and
   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the composition profiles of poly- and
   perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) in our living environment are unclear.
   In this study, 25 PFASs were analyzed in indoor dust samples collected
   from urban, industrial, and e-waste dismantling areas in China. PFOS
   alternatives, including 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate
   (6:2 Cl-PFESA) (median: 5.52 ng/g) and 8:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated
   ether sulfonate (8:2 Cl-PFESA) (1.81 ng/g), were frequently detected. By
   contrast, PFOA alternatives, such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer
   acid (HPFO-DA, Gen-X) and ammonium 4,8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoate
   (ADONA), were not found in any of the dust samples. As expected, all
   legacy PFASs were widely observed in indoor dust, and 4 PFAS precursors
   were also detected. Dust concentrations of 6:2 Cl- PFESA were strongly
   correlated (p < 0.05) with those of 8:2 Cl-PFESA regardless of sampling
   sites. 6:2 Cl-PFESA was also significantly associated with that of PFOS
   in industrial and e-waste (p < 0.01) areas. Association analysis
   suggested that the sources of PFOS and its alternatives are common or
   related. Although Sigma Cl-PFESA concentration was lower than that of
   PFOS (17.4 ng/g), industrial areas had the highest 6:2 Cl-PFESA/PFOS
   ratio (0.63). Composition profiles of PFASs in the industrial area
   showed the forefront of fluorine change. Thus, the present findings
   suggested that Cl-PFESAs are widely used as PFOS alternatives in China,
   and high levels of human Cl-PFESA exposure are expected in the future.
   Short-chain PFASs (C4-C7) were the predominant PFASs found in dust
   samples, contributing to over 40% of Sigma total PFASs. Furthermore,
   perfluoro-1-butanesulfonate/PFOS and perfluoro-n-butanoic acid
   (PFBA)/PFOA ratios were 2.8 and 0.72, respectively. These findings
   suggested shifting to the short-chain PFASs in the environment in China.
   To the authors knowledge this is the first study to document the levels
   of 6:2 Cl-PFESA, 8:2 Cl-PFESA in indoor dust. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The public's purchase incentive increases dramatically during the
   holiday season and subsequently returns to normal levels. This
   seasonality is common in various scenarios and highlights the following
   questions: how does the public's purchase incentive fluctuate over the
   course of a year? Which factors are conducive to this seasonal behavior
   and how can they be modeled? In this paper, we propose a model that
   explicitly integrates temporal point process theory with the
   construction of a networked community, to describe the dynamics of
   collective action propagation with seasonal fluctuation. Furthermore, a
   database is constructed of sales records for 21 video game consoles and
   13 237 video games in France, Germany, Japan, the U.K., the USA, and
   worldwide from 1989 to 2018. Experimental results suggest that peak
   desire always appears in the holiday season about one week before
   Christmas and is about four times higher than consumption desire in a
   normal period in all areas.

TI Programmed PPAR-alpha downregulation induces inflammaging by suppressing

AB Inflammagingis associated with an increased risk of chronic disease.
   Monocytes are the principal immune cells for the production of
   inflammatory cytokines and contribute to inflammaging in the elderly.
   However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we
   found that monocytes from aged individuals contained high levels of
   lipid droplets (LDs), and this increase was correlated with impaired
   fatty acid oxidation. Downregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated
   receptor (PPAR)-alpha may be responsible for the pro-inflammatory
   phenotype of monocytes in aged individuals, as it was positively
   correlated with LD accumulation and increasing TNF-alpha concentration.
   Interestingly, interventions that result in PPAR-alpha upregulation,
   such as fenofibrate treatment, TNF-alpha neutralization, or calorie
   restriction, reversed the effect of aging on monocytes. Thus the
   downregulation of PPAR-alpha and LD levels in monocytes represents a
   novel biomarker for inflammaging. Furthermore, PPAR-alpha activation in
   the elderly may also alleviate long-term inflammaging, preventing the
   development of life-limiting chronic diseases.

AB Estrogen deficiency induces cardiac dysfunction and increases the risk
   of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women and in those who
   underwent bilateral oophorectomy. Previous evidence suggests that
   puerarin, a phytoestrogen, exerts beneficial effects on cardiac function
   in patients with cardiac hypertrophy. In this study, we investigated
   whether puerarin could prevent cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in
   ovariectomized, aortic-banded rats. Female SD rats subjected to
   bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) plus abdominal aortic constriction (AAC).
   The rats were treated with puerarin (50 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), ip) for 8
   weeks. Then echocardiography was assessed, and the rats were sacrificed,
   their heart tissues were extracted and allocated for further
   experiments. We showed that puerarin administration significantly
   attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in AAC-treated OVX rats,
   which could be attributed to activation of PPAR alpha/PPAR gamma
   coactivator-1 (PGC-1) pathway. Puerarin administration significantly
   increased the expression of estrogen-related receptor alpha, nuclear
   respiratory factor 1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A in
   hearts. Moreover, puerarin administration regulated the expression of
   metabolic genes in AAC-treated OVX rats. Hypertrophic changes could be
   induced in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) in vitro by treatment with
   angiotensin II (Ang II, 1 mu M), which was attenuated by co-treatemnt
   with puerarin (100 mu M). We further showed that puerarin decreased Ang
   II-induced accumulation of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and
   deletion of ATP, attenuated the Ang II-induced dissipation of the
   mitochondrial membrane potential, and improved the mitochondrial
   dysfunction in NRCM. Furthermore, addition of PPAR alpha antagonist
   GW6471 (10 mu M) partially abolished the anti-hypertrophic effects and
   metabolic effects of puerarin in NRCM. In conclusion, puerarin prevents
   cardiac hypertrophy in AAC-treated OVX rats through activation of PPAR
   alpha/PGC-1 pathway and regulation of energy metabolism remodeling. This
   may provide a new approach to prevent the development of heart failure
   in postmenopausal women.

AB Background Acute respiratory infections (ARI) cause considerable
   morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children.
   Unfortunately, there are limited multi-center data on common viral
   respiratory infections in south China. Methods A total of 4403 nasal
   swabs were collected from children in 10 cities in Guangdong, China in
   2019. Seven respiratory viruses, influenza A virus (IFA), influenza B
   virus (IFB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenoviruses (ADV) and
   parainfluenza virus types 1-3 (PIV1, PIV2 and PIV3), were detected by
   direct immunofluorescence antibody assay. The personal information and
   clinical characteristics were recorded and analyzed. Results The results
   showed that at least one virus was detected in 1099 (24.96 %) samples.
   The detection rates of RSV, IFA, ADV, PIV3, PIV1 and PIV2 were 7.13 %
   (314/4403), 5.31 % (234/4403), 4.02 % (177/4403), 3.04 % (134/4403),
   1.70 % (75/4403) and 1.16 % (51/4403), respectively. The detection rate
   of RSV was highest in 0-6-month-old children at 18.18 % (106/583), while
   the detection rate of IFA was highest in 12-18-year-old children at
   20.48 % (17/83). The total detection rates in winter and spring were
   35.67 % (219/614) and 34.56 % (403/1166), higher than those in summer,
   17.41 % (284/1631), and autumn, 19.46 % (193/992). Conclusions RSV and
   IFA were the main respiratory viruses in children. With increasing age
   the detection rate of RSV decreased in children, but the trends for the
   detection rates of IFA and IFB were the opposite. This study provided
   the viral etiology and epidemiology of pediatric patients with ARI in
   Guangdong, China.
